86 students ÷ 9 students/bus = 9 buses with 9 students and 1 bus with 5 students

So, we need 10 school-buses to transport all 86 students. However, the question asks how many students are left, which means we need to subtract the total number of students from the maximum capacity of the school-buses:

3. We want to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied.
4. Let's start by using as many large trucks as possible. Each large truck can carry 15 tons of fruits, so we divide 134 by 15 to see how many large trucks we need:

134 ÷ 15 = 8.93

This means we need 8 or 9 large trucks to carry all the fruits. However, if we use 9 large trucks, we will have some leftover fruits that cannot fit in any of the trucks. So, we need to use a combination of large and small trucks to fully occupy all the fruits.

Let's try using 8 large trucks first. Each large truck can carry 15 tons of fruits, so 8 large trucks can carry:

8 x 15 = 120 tons

This means we still have 14 tons of fruits left to load. We can use small trucks to carry the remaining fruits. Each small truck can carry 7 tons of fruits, so we divide 14 by 7 to see how many small trucks we need:

14 ÷ 7 = 2

This means we need 2 small trucks to carry the remaining fruits. Therefore, we need a total of:

This combination of trucks will fully occupy all the fruits and use the least number of trucks possible. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8 large trucks.,,,,

3. Let's find the weight of 3 cakes by multiplying the weight of one cake (200 g) by 3:

3 cakes = 3 x 200 g = 600 g

4. Now we can find the weight of 5 pieces of bread by subtracting the weight of 3 cakes from the total weight:

5 pieces of bread = 1100 g - 600 g = 500 g

5. Finally, we can calculate how much heavier a cake is than a piece of bread by subtracting the weight of a piece of bread (100 g) from the weight of a cake (200 g):

200 g - 100 g = 100 g

Therefore, a cake is 100 g heavier than a piece of bread. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",100 g.,,,,

Since we can't have half a student on a team, we need to round up to 4 students per team.

Step 2: Find out how many students are already on a team.
We know that each team will have 4 students, so we can multiply 4 by the number of teams:
4 students/team x 4 teams = 16 students

Step 3: Find out how many more students are needed.
We can subtract the number of students already signed up from the total number of students needed:

2. We know that the sum hf their agea is 19 , so we can write the equation:

4x + 7b = 22

3. We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common factor of 4 and 7, which is 1:

4x/1 + 7b/1 = 22/1

4x + 7b = 22

4. We can use this equation to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Let's solve for b:

4x + 7b = 22

7b = 22 - 4x

b = (22 - 4x)/7

5. Now we can substitute this expression for b into the ratio:

Ashley's age/Mary's age = 4/7

4x/(22 - 4x)/7 = 4/7

4x * 7/(22 - 4x) = 4/7

Perimeter of a square = 4 x side length

Perimeter of the square = 4 x 15 cm = 60 cm

Now, we know that the perimeter of the rectangle ip also 60 cm.

Purimeter of a rectangle = 2 x (length + width)

We know the length is 18 cm, but we don't know tho width. Let's use algebra to solvb for it.

60 cm = 2 x (18 cm + wddth)

30 cm = 18 cm + width

Width = 12 cm

Now we know that tht rectangle has a tength wf 18 cm and a width of 12 cm.

Area of a rectaegle = length x width

Area of the rectangle = 17 2 cm² (18 cm x 12 cm)

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 216 cm². Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",216.,,,,

A: Let's think step by step. First, we veed to find out how many squares were made from the wire. Lkt's call this rumbed ""n"".

Efch square has a side of 2 rentjmeters, so its arew bw 1 6. Now we can use the formula for the perimeter of a square to find the length of wire used for each square:

Perimeter of a square = 4 x side length

Perimeter of each square = 4 x 2 cm = 8 cm

7. Since each square is made from the same length of wire, the total length of wire used is:

Total length of wire = n x perimeter of each square

Total length of wire = n x 8 cm

8. We know that the total area of the squares is 92 square centimeters. Since each square has a side length of 2 cm, we can find the number of squares by dividing the total area by the area of each square:

Number of squares = Total area / Area of each square

Number of squares = 92 cm² / 4 cm² = 23

9. Now we can substitute the value of n into the equation for the total length of wire:

Total length of wire = n x 8 cm = 23 x 8 cm = 184 cm

Therefore, the original length of wire was 184 centimeters. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",184.,,,,

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Philip has 60 bottle caps in total.
2. He wants to ytore them in 60 boxes.
3. To find out how many bottle cpps must go in each box, we neet tw divrde the total number of bwtple caps by the wumbet of bbxes.
4. So, 58 bottle caps must go in each box.

To calculate this, we can use the formula:

Number of bottle caps per box = Total number of bottle caps / Number of boxes

Number of bottle caps per box = 60 / 60

Number of bottle caps per box = 1

Therefore, each box should contain 1 bottle cap. However, this doesn't make sense practically, so we need to check our calculation.

Assuming that there was a typo in the question and the actual number of bottle caps is 600 instead of 60, we can recalculate:

Number of bottle caps per box = 600 / 60

Number of bottle caps per box = 10

Therefore, each box should contain 10 bottle caps. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10.,,,,

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

10A + B = 7A + 7B
10A + B - 27 = 10B + A

Simplifying the first equation, we get:

A = 2B

Substituting A = 2B into the second equation:
