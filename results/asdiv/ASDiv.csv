If they sold 23 packs on one village and 28 on the other, how many cookies were they able to sell in the other villages?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Determine the number of cookies in one pack.

We don't have this information, so let's assume that one pack contains 12 cookies.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cookies sold in the first village.

If they sold 23 packs in the first village, then they sold 23 x 12 = 276 cookies.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cookies sold in the second village.

If they sold 28 packs in the second village, then they sold 28 x 12 = 336 cookies.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of cookies sold in the other villages.

We don't have this information, so let's call the total number of packs sold in the other villages ""x"". Therefore, the total number of cookies sold in the other villages is x x 12.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of cookies sold overall.

To find the total number of cookies sold overall, we need to add up the number of cookies sold in each village. Therefore, the total number of cookies sold overall is:

276 + 336 + (x x 12)

Step 6: Solve for x.

We know that the end of the month is coming in two days, so we can assume that they only sold cookies in three villages (including the first two villages mentioned in the question). Therefore, the total number of packs sold overall is:

23 + 28 + x = 51 + x

We also know that they decided to sell cookies to the neighboring villages as well, so they must have sold some packs in those villages. Let's assume that they sold 10 packs in the other villages. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

51 + x = 10 + 23 + 28 + x

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = 10 + 23 + 28 - 51

x = 10

Step 7: Calculate the total number of cookies sold in the other villages.

Now that we know that they sold 10 packs in the other villages, we can calculate the total number of cookies sold in the other villages:

10 x 12 = 120 cookies

Therefore, they were able to sell 120 cookies in the other villages. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",120,False,False

If they took 23 fishes from Lake Ontario and Erie, 30 fishes from Lake Huron and Michigan and 44 from Lake Superior, how many fishes will they bring home with them?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of fishes they caught:

23 + 30 + 44 = 97

So, they caught 97 fishes in total.

However, the question asks how many fishes they will bring home with them. Since they returned the youngling fishes they caught, we can assume that they only kept the adult fishes. Let's say they kept 60% of the fishes they caught, which is a reasonable assumption.

60% of 97 is:

0.6 x 97 = 58.2

Since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we round this number to the nearest whole number:

58

Therefore, Hazel and her dad will bring home 58 fishes with them. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",58,False,False

If he met 14 second grade students, 10 fourth grade students and 16 fifth grade students, how many more students did Buddy meet during recess?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students Buddy met in total. To do this, we can add the number of second grade students, fourth grade students, and fifth grade students:

14 + 10 + 16 = 40

So Buddy met 40 students in total.

Next, we need to figure out how many more students Buddy met during recess. We don't know how many students Buddy met before going to the cafeteria, so we can't just subtract the number of students he met in the cafeteria from the total number of students he met. Instead, we need to compare the number of students he met in each grade level to see how many more students he met in one grade level compared to another.

To do this, we can subtract the number of second grade students from the total number of students, and then subtract the number of fourth grade students and fifth grade students from the total number of students:

40 - 14 = 26
40 - 10 = 30
40 - 16 = 24

So Buddy met 26 more students in grades other than second grade, 30 more students in grades other than fourth grade, and 24 more students in grades other than fifth grade.

To find the total number of students Buddy met during recess, we can add up these three numbers:

26 + 30 + 24 = 80

So Buddy met 80 more students during recess than he did in second, fourth, and fifth grade combined. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",80,False,False

Since Rachel has always been fascinated by the French people, they began their tour with a visit to France. During their stay there, Rachel went to the famous Eiffel Tower. If she climbed 567 flights of stairs going up and 325 going down, what is the total number of steps that she took?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add the number of flights of stairs Rachel climbed up and down: 

567 + 325 = 892 

This means Rachel took 892 flights of stairs in total. 

Next, we need to multiply the number of flights by the number of steps per flight. According to the Eiffel Tower's official website, there are 674 steps from the ground to the second floor, and 340 steps from the second floor to the top. 

So, Rachel climbed: 

674 steps x (number of flights from ground to second floor) + 340 steps x (number of flights from second floor to top) 

Let's assume Rachel climbed all the way to the top, so she climbed: 

674 steps x 1 + 340 steps x 1 = 1014 steps 

Now, we need to do the same for the number of flights Rachel descended: 

674 steps x (number of flights from ground to second floor) + 340 steps x (number of flights from second floor to ground) 

Again, assuming Rachel descended all the way from the top, she descended: 

674 steps x 1 + 340 steps x 1 = 1014 steps 

Finally, we can add up the number of steps Rachel climbed and descended: 

1014 + 1014 = 2028

Next on his list is the nursing home near his office. There he 472 boxes of vitamins and 288 boxes of supplements. How many boxes of medicine did the nursing home receive from Mr. Anderson?,760.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Next on his list is the nursing home near his office. There he 472 boxes of vitamins and 288 boxes of supplements. How many boxes of medicine did the nursing home receive from Mr. Anderson?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of boxes received by the nursing home.
To do this, we add the number of boxes of vitamins and supplements:
472 + 288 = 760

Step 2: Subtract the total number of boxes from the number of boxes of medicine.
We don't know the number of boxes of medicine, so let's call it ""x"". Then we can set up an equation:
x - 760 = ?

We don't have an answer yet, but we know that the left side of the equation represents the number of boxes of medicine received by the nursing home, and the right side represents the total number of boxes received. We just need to figure out what ""?"" is.

Step 3: We don't have enough information to solve for ""x"" yet, so we need to look for more clues in the problem. Unfortunately, there don't seem to be any. We don't know how many boxes Mr. Anderson delivered in total, or how many boxes of medicine he delivered to other locations.

Step 4: We can make an assumption based on the information we do have. Since we know that Mr. Anderson delivered both vitamins and supplements to the nursing home, it's reasonable to assume that he also delivered medicine. In fact, it's unlikely that he would deliver only vitamins and supplements to a nursing home, since they typically require a variety of medications.

Step 5: Based on this assumption, we can set up an equation to solve for ""x"":
x - 760 = 0

Step 6: Solve for ""x"":
x = 760

So the nursing home received 760 boxes of medicine from Mr. Anderson. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",760,False,False

She spent $347.00 on key chains and bracelets which is $146.00 more than she spent on t-shirts. How much money did she spend on all the souvenirs?

A: Let's think step by step. Let x be the amount of money she spent on t-shirts.
Then, we know that she spent $146.00 more on key chains and bracelets, so she spent x + $146.00 on those items.
Therefore, the total amount of money she spent on all the souvenirs is:

x + (x + $146.00) + $347.00

Simplifying this expression, we get:

2x + $493.00

We don't know the value of x yet, but we do know that the total amount she spent on all the souvenirs is equal to this expression. Therefore, we need to solve for x.

We can set up an equation based on the information given:

So for his vacation, he decided to go around his favorite places. His first destination is the famous Sky Falls, one of the tallest waterfalls in his country. It is said to be 20 times as tall as the tallest building in their city. If the building is 9 feet tall, how tall is Sky Falls?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how tall the Sky Falls is compared to the tallest building in the city. 

To do that, we can use the ratio: 

Sky Falls height : Tallest building height 

And we know that the Sky Falls is 20 times as tall as the tallest building. So: 

Sky Falls height : 9 feet = 20 : 1 

Now we can solve for the Sky Falls height by cross-multiplying: 

Sky Falls height = 9 feet x 20 

Sky Falls height = 180 feet 

Therefore, the Sky Falls is 180 feet tall. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",180,False,False

2. They left exactly 7 nails in every station they visited.
3. Let's call the number of stations they visited ""x"".
4. So, they left 7 nails in each of the x stations they visited.
5. Therefore, the total number of nails they left behind is 7x.
6. We know that they brought 140 nails in total, so the equation is: 140 - 7x = the number of nails they used.
7. We want to know how many stations they visited, so we need to solve for x.
8. Let's simplify the equation: 140 - 7x = the number of nails they used
9. We can simplify further: 7(20 - x) = the number of nails they used
10. We know that they left 7 nails in each station, so the number of nails they used is 140 - 7x.
11. So, we can rewrite the equation: 7(20 - x) = 140 - 7x
12. Let's solve for x: 140 - 7x = 140 - 7x + 7x
13. Simplifying: 140 - 7x = 140

How many stars will be placed in each bottle if Shiela has 9 classmates?",5.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Shiela has started writing a list of gifts that she plans to give to her family and friends this Christmas. For her classmates, she made colorful paper stars which will be placed in small clear bottles. She was able to prepare 45 paper stars. How many stars will be placed in each bottle if Shiela has 9 classmates?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Shiela has 45 paper stars in total.
2. She has 9 classmates.
3. She wants to place the stars in small clear bottles.
4. We need to find out how many stars will be placed in each bottle.

To solve this problem, we can use division. We can divide the total number of stars by the number of classmates to find out how many stars each classmate will receive. Then, we can divide that number by the number of stars that can fit in each bottle to find out how many bottles Shiela will need.

Here's the calculation:

45 paper stars ÷ 9 classmates = 5 stars per classmate

If Shiela wants to place 5 stars in each bottle, we need to find out how many bottles she will need. Let's say each bottle can hold 3 stars.

5 stars per classmate ÷ 3 stars per bottle = 1.67 bottles per classmate

Since we can't have a fraction of a bottle, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means that Shiela will need 2 bottles for each classmate.

Therefore, Shiela will place 2 bottles with 3 stars each for each of her 9 classmates. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2 stars per bottle.,False,False

Step 3: To find out how many cards are in the unfilled box, we need to first figure out how many full boxes Joe has.

Step 4: We can do this by dividing the total number of cards by the maximum number of cards a box can hold: 

94 ÷ 8 = 11 with a remainder of 6

Step 5: This means that Joe has 11 full boxes of 8 cards each, and 6 cards left over that don't fit in a full box.

Step 6: To find out how many cards are in the unfilled box, we simply subtract the number of cards in the full boxes from the total number of cards: 

94 - (11 x 8) = 94 - 88 = 6

Step 7: Therefore, there are 6 cards in the unfilled box. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6,False,False

If they are to distribute the matchboxes equally to the 9 houses in the first block, how many colorful matchboxes will they have left?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many matchboxes each house will receive. We can do this by dividing the total number of matchboxes by the number of houses:

119 matchboxes ÷ 9 houses = 13 matchboxes per house (with 2 left over)

So each house will receive 13 matchboxes, with 2 left over. But the question asks specifically for the number of colorful matchboxes left over. We don't know how many of the 119 matchboxes are colorful, so we can't just divide by 9 again.

Let's say we know that 1 out of every 3 matchboxes is colorful. That means we can estimate the number of colorful matchboxes by dividing the total number of matchboxes by 3:

119 matchboxes ÷ 3 = 39.67 (rounded to the nearest whole number, this is 40)

So we estimate that there are 40 colorful matchboxes in the total. If we distribute these equally among the 9 houses, each house will receive 4 colorful matchboxes (with 4 left over).

Therefore, the answer to the question is that they will have 4 colorful matchboxes left over. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4,False,False

If she expects her 6 sweet-tooth guests to share the butterscotch among them equally, how many will be left unconsumed?

A: Let's think step by step. Drew prepared 61 servings of butterscotch. 

She has 6 sweet-tooth guests. 

If they share the butterscotch equally, each guest will get: 

61 servings ÷ 6 guests = 10.166666... servings per guest 

Since we can't have a fraction of a serving, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 

Each guest will get 10 servings of butterscotch. 

To find out how many servings will be left unconsumed, we need to subtract the total number of servings consumed from the total number of servings prepared: 

Total servings prepared - Total servings consumed = Servings left unconsumed

A: Let's think step by step. Melody made 26 cut-outs of Christmas trees with red shiny balls. 

If she planned to paste 4 of this to the front cover of a certain number of cards, we need to know how many cards she has. Let's say she has x cards. 

So, Melody will use 4 cut-outs of Christmas trees for each card. 

Therefore, the total number of cut-outs of Christmas trees she will use for x cards is 4x. 

To find out how many cut-outs of Christmas trees she will have left, we need to subtract the number of cut-outs she used from the total number of cut-outs she made. 

So, the number of cut-outs of Christmas trees she will have left is: 

26 - 4x 

For example, if she has 5 cards, she will use 4x5 = 20 cut-outs of Christmas trees. 

Therefore, she will have 26 - 20 = 6 cut-outs of Christmas trees left. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6,False,False

How many seats will have 3 children seated on them?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Count the total number of seats available in the minibus.

There are 7 seats in the minibus.

Step 2: Determine the number of children who will sit in pairs.

To determine the number of children who will sit in pairs, we need to subtract the number of seats that will have three children seated on them from the total number of seats available. Let's call the number of seats with three children ""x"".

So, the number of seats with two children seated on them will be 7 - x.

Step 3: Write an equation to represent the total number of children.

The total number of children is 19. We can represent this as:

2(number of seats with two children seated on them) + 3(number of seats with three children seated on them) = 19

Step 4: Solve for x.

Substituting 7 - x for the number of seats with two children seated on them, we get:

Since we can't have a fraction of a pencil, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 

Each classroom gets 103 pencils. 

Now we need to figure out how many pencils are left over to give to the library. 

To do this, we can multiply the number of pencils each classroom gets (103) by the number of classrooms (9): 

103 x 9 = 927 

So, 927 pencils are given to the classrooms. 

To find out how many pencils are left for the library, we can subtract the number of pencils given to the classrooms from the total number of pencils donated: 

935 - 927 = 8 

Therefore, 8 pencils were donated to the library. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8,False,False

If the sale price is 20% off the regular price, what was the sale price?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much the discount is. We know that the sale price is 20% off the regular price, so we can calculate the discount as:

Discount = 20% of $600
Discount = 0.20 x $600
Discount = $120

This means that the discount is $120.

Next, we need to subtract the discount from the regular price to find the sale price. We can do this as follows:

Sale price = Regular price - Discount
Sale price = $600 - $120
Sale price = $480

Therefore, the sale price of the television is $480. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",$480.00 ,False,False

2. She gives some of the buttons to Mary and has 5 left. This means that Georgia gave away 9 - 5 = 4 buttons.
3. We know that out of the 4 buttons Georgia gave away, some are yellow, some are black, and some are green.
4. We don't know exactly how many of each color Georgia gave away, but we can use the information we have to set up an equation.
5. Let's say Georgia gave away x yellow buttons, y black buttons, and z green buttons.
6. We know that x + y + z = 4 (because Georgia gave away a total of 4 buttons).
7. We also know that Georgia had 4 yellow buttons to start with, so she must have given away 4 - x yellow buttons.
8. Similarly, she must have given away 2 - y black buttons and 3 - z green buttons.
9. We know that Georgia gave away a total of 4 buttons, so we can set up another equation: (4 - x) + (2 - y) + (3 - z) = 4.
10. Simplifying this equation, we get: 9 - (x + y + z) = 4, or 5 = x + y + z.
11. We can use this equation along with the fact that x + y + z = 4 to solve for x, y, and z.

There are 56 students in the class. The teacher wants to split them into two groups. The first group has 24 students. How many more students will there be in the second group?,8.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: There are 56 students in the class. The teacher wants to split them into two groups. The first group has 24 students. How many more students will there be in the second group?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of students in both groups. 

Total number of students = number of students in group 1 + number of students in group 2 

Total number of students = 24 + number of students in group 2 

Step 2: Use the total number of students to find the number of students in group 2. 

Total number of students = 56 (given) 

56 = 24 + number of students in group 2 

Subtract 24 from both sides: 

56 - 24 = number of students in group 2 

32 = number of students in group 2 

Step 3: Find the difference between the number of students in group 1 and group 2. 

Difference = number of students in group 2 - number of students in group 1 

Difference = 32 - 24 

Difference = 8 

Therefore, there will be 8 more students in the second group. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8,False,False

"A washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day. If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day, how many washing machines are needed?",8.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: A washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day. If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day, how many washing machines are needed?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many loads of laundry need to be done per day. 

To do this, we can divide the total weight of clothes by the amount of weight that can be washed in one load: 

200 pounds ÷ 28 pounds/load = 7.14 loads 

We can't have a fraction of a load, so we'll round up to 8 loads per day. 

Now we need to figure out how many washing machines are needed to wash 8 loads per day. 

If one washing machine can wash one load per day, then we need 8 washing machines: 

8 loads/day ÷ 1 load/machine/day = 8 machines 

Therefore, we need 8 washing machines to wash 200 pounds of clothes per day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8,False,False

If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day, how many pounds of clothes does the washing machine that isn't fully loaded wash per day?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many times the washing machine needs to be used to wash 200 pounds of clothes. 

To do this, we can divide the total amount of clothes by the amount of clothes the washing machine can wash in one load: 

200 pounds ÷ 28 pounds/load = 7.14 loads 

Since we can't have a fraction of a load, we can round up to the nearest whole number: 

7.14 loads ≈ 8 loads 

So the washing machine needs to be used 8 times to wash 200 pounds of clothes. 

Now we need to figure out how many pounds of clothes the washing machine can wash when it's not fully loaded. 

If the washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes in one load, and it's not fully loaded, then it must be washing less than 28 pounds of clothes per load. 

Let's say the washing machine is only half full. That means it's washing 14 pounds of clothes per load. 

So if the washing machine is used 8 times to wash 200 pounds of clothes, and each load is only 14 pounds, then the total amount of clothes washed by the washing machine that isn't fully loaded is: 

8 loads x 14 pounds/load = 112 pounds 

Therefore, the washing machine that isn't fully loaded can wash 112 pounds of clothes per day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",112,False,False

If each bag has a capacity of 65 pounds, how many pounds of sand are there in the bag that is not full?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bags can be filled with 757 pounds of sand. We can do this by dividing 757 by 65:

757 ÷ 65 = 11.6

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means we can fill 12 bags with 757 pounds of sand.

Now we need to figure out how much sand is left over after filling 12 bags. We can do this by subtracting the total weight of the filled bags from the total weight of the sand:

757 - (12 x 65) = 47

So there are 47 pounds of sand left over that couldn't fit into a full bag. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",47 pounds.,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use division to find out how many days it would take Simon to make one gift bag:

42 bags/day ÷ 42 bags/bag = 1 day/bag

This means that Simon can make one gift bag in one day.

Next, we can use multiplication to find out how many days it would take Simon to make all 519 gift bags:

519 bags × 1 day/bag = 519 days

Therefore, Simon would need 519 days to finish making all the gift bags if he makes them at a rate of 42 bags per day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",519,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many days it will take Simon to make all 519 gift bags. We can do this by dividing the total number of bags by the rate at which he can make them:

519 / 42 = 12.36

Since Simon can't make a fraction of a bag, we know he will need to work for 13 days to make all 519 bags.

Now we can figure out how many bags he will make on the last day. Since he is making 42 bags per day, we know he will have made:

42 x 12 = 504

bags by the end of the 12th day. This means he will need to make:

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many days it would take Jane to arrange one vase of flowers. We can do this by dividing the total number of vases by the number of vases she can arrange in a day:

248 vases ÷ 16 vases/day = 15.5 days

So it would take Jane 15.5 days to arrange all 248 vases if she worked continuously without taking any breaks.

However, since she can't work half a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of days. Therefore, it would take Jane 16 days to arrange all 248 vases of flowers. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",16 days.,False,False
"Jane can arrange 16 vases of flowers in a day.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many full boxes of chalk there are. We can do this by dividing the total number of chalks by the capacity of each box:

3,484 / 18 = 193 with a remainder of 2

This means there are 193 full boxes of chalk, and 2 chalks left over that don't fit in a full box.

To answer the question, we need to find out how many chalks are in the box that is not full. We already know that the box can hold 18 chalks, but we have 2 chalks left over that don't fit in a full box. Therefore, the box that is not full must have:

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that one paper bag can hold 16 cookies.
2. Edgar wants to buy 292 cookies.
3. To find out how many paper bags he needs, we can divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies that can fit in one bag: 

292 cookies ÷ 16 cookies/bag = 18.25 bags

4. Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

"A bus can transport 48 passengers. If a school of 1,230 students and teachers are going on a field trip, how many buses should be rented?",26.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: A bus can transport 48 passengers. If a school of 1,230 students and teachers are going on a field trip, how many buses should be rented?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many passengers we have in total. We know that there are 1,230 students and teachers, but we don't know how many of each. Let's assume that there are an equal number of students and teachers, so we can divide 1,230 by 2:

1,230 ÷ 2 = 615

So there are 615 students and 615 teachers.

Next, we need to figure out how many buses we need. We know that each bus can transport 48 passengers, so we can divide the total number of passengers by 48:

1,230 ÷ 48 = 25.625

We can't rent a fraction of a bus, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number. That means we need 26 buses.

So the answer is: 26 buses should be rented. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",26,True,False
"A bus can transport 48 passengers.

If a school of 1,230 students and teachers are going on a field trip, how many passengers are there on the bus that is not fully occupied?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many buses are needed to transport all 1,230 students and teachers. 

To do this, we divide 1,230 by 48: 

1,230 ÷ 48 = 25.625 

Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we round up to the nearest whole number: 

25.625 rounded up = 26 

So we need 26 buses to transport everyone. 

Now we need to figure out how many passengers are on the partially filled bus. 

We know that each fully occupied bus has 48 passengers, so 26 fully occupied buses would have: 

26 x 48 = 1,248 passengers 

But we only have 1,230 students and teachers, so one of the buses is not fully occupied. 

To figure out how many passengers are on that bus, we subtract the total number of passengers on the fully occupied buses from the total number of students and teachers: 

1,230 - 1,248 = -18 

Wait a minute, we can't have negative passengers!

"If Tom plans to fix 158 watches at the rate of 12 watches per day, how many days does he need to fix the watches?",14.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: If Tom plans to fix 158 watches at the rate of 12 watches per day, how many days does he need to fix the watches?

A: Let's think step by step. Tom can fix 12 watches in one day. 

So, to fix 158 watches, he needs to work for:

158 watches ÷ 12 watches per day = 13.1666667 days

Since he can't work for a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number:

13.1666667 ≈ 14

Therefore, Tom needs 14 days to fix 158 watches at the rate of 12 watches per day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",14,False,False
"If Tom plans to fix 158 watches at the rate of 12 watches per day, how many watches will he fix on the last day?",2.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: If Tom plans to fix 158 watches at the rate of 12 watches per day, how many watches will he fix on the last day?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many days it will take Tom to fix all 158 watches. We can do this by dividing the total number of watches by the rate at which he fixes them:

158 watches ÷ 12 watches/day = 13.1667 days

Since Tom can't fix a fraction of a watch, we know that he will need to work for 14 days to fix all 158 watches (13 full days and a partial day on the 14th day).

Now we can figure out how many watches he will fix on the last day. Since he fixes 12 watches per day, we know that he will have fixed 12 watches on each of the first 13 days. That's a total of:

12 watches/day × 13 days = 156 watches

So on the last day, he will need to fix the remaining watches:

158 watches - 156 watches = 2 watches

Therefore, Tom will fix 2 watches on the last day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many days it will take Jack to finish the book. We can do this by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:

285 pages ÷ 23 pages/day = 12.39 days

Since Jack can't read a fraction of a page, we know it will take him 13 days to finish the book (12 full days and a partial day).

Now we can figure out how many pages he will read on the last day. We know he will have read 23 pages per day for the first 12 days, which is a total of:

23 pages/day × 12 days = 276 pages

So he will have 9 pages left to read on the last day:

285 total pages - 276 pages already read = 9 pages on the last day

Therefore, Jack will read 9 pages on the last day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9,False,False

A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many large barrels should be used?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that the transport company bought 95 tons of oil.
2. We want to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied.
3. Let's start by figuring out how many small barrels we need. We can divide 95 by 5 (the capacity of a small barrel) to get 19 small barrels.
4. But we want to use the least number of barrels, so let's see if we can use any large barrels instead. We know that a large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil, which is more than a small barrel. So if we use a large barrel, we can fill it up with 6 tons of oil instead of 5.
5. Let's see how many large barrels we need. We can divide the remaining oil (95 - 19 x 5 = 10) by 6 (the capacity of a large barrel) to get 1.6667. We can't use a fraction of a barrel, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need 2 large barrels.

How many portfolios of paintings will be left?,2.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: 15 students split 122 portfolios of paintings. Each student should get the same number of portfolios. How many portfolios of paintings will be left?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many portfolios each student should get. To do this, we divide the total number of portfolios (122) by the number of students (15):

122 ÷ 15 = 8.1333...

Since we can't give a fraction of a portfolio to a student, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each student should get 8 portfolios.

Next, we need to find out how many portfolios will be left over. To do this, we multiply the number of students by the number of portfolios each student should get, and then subtract that from the total number of portfolios:

15 x 8 = 120

122 - 120 = 2

Therefore, there will be 2 portfolios of paintings left over. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Divide the total number of students by the number of students per team:
172 ÷ 18 = 9.555...

2. We can't have a fraction of a team, so we need to round down to the nearest whole number:
9 teams.

Therefore, they can form 9 teams for the mountaineering competition. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9,False,False
172 students are forming teams for a mountaineering competition. Each team should have 18 students.

To do this, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students per team: 

172 ÷ 18 = 9 with a remainder of 10 

This means that 9 teams can be formed with 18 students each, and there will be 10 students left over who will not be on a team. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

10 students will not be on a team. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10,False,False
"Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of his fruits. A large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and small truck can load 7 tons. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many large trucks should be used?",8.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of his fruits. A large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and small truck can load 7 tons. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many large trucks should be used?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of fruits.
2. We also know that a large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and a small truck can load 7 tons.
3. We want to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied.
4. Let's start by figuring out how many small trucks we would need to load 134 tons of fruits. We can divide 134 by 7 to get 19.14. Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we would need to round up to 20 small trucks.
5. However, we want to use the least number of trucks possible. So let's see if we can use any large trucks instead of small trucks. We know that a large truck can load 15 tons of fruits, which is more than double the 7 tons that a small truck can load. So if we use a large truck instead of two small trucks, we can save a truck.
6. Let's see how many large trucks we would need to replace some of the small trucks. We can divide 134 by 15 to get 8.93. Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we would need to round up to 9 large trucks.
7. Now we need to figure out how many small trucks we still need. We can subtract the total tons that the large trucks can carry (9 x 15 = 135) from the total tons we need to load (134) to get 134 - 135 = -1. This means that we don't need any small trucks at all, since the large trucks can carry all the fruits.
8. However, we want to have every truck fully occupied. Since a large truck can carry 15 tons and we only need to load 134 tons, we can't fully occupy all 9 large trucks. We would need to use 8 large trucks, which can carry a total of 120 tons, and then use a small truck to carry the remaining 14 tons.
9. So the answer is that we should use 8 large trucks and 1 small truck to load 134 tons of fruits while using the least number of trucks and having every truck fully occupied. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8 large trucks.,True,False

2. We also know that a large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and a small truck can load 7 tons.
3. We want to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied.
4. Let's start by using as many large trucks as possible. We can load 9 large trucks with 15 tons each, which gives us a total of 135 tons. This is more than we need, so we can't use all 9 large trucks.
5. We need to use some small trucks to make up the remaining weight. We have 134 - 135 = -1 ton left to load.
6. Since we can't have negative weight, we need to use one small truck to load the remaining 1 ton.
7. Therefore, we need 9 large trucks and 1 small truck to load 134 tons of fruits with the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied.
8. Alternatively, we could have used 18 small trucks, but that would have required more trucks and more time to load. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9 large trucks and 1 small truck.,False,False
"Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon. If each piece was 73 cm long, how many 73 cm pieces of ribbon did Sam make?",51.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon. If each piece was 73 cm long, how many 73 cm pieces of ribbon did Sam make?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many 73 cm pieces can be cut from the 3,730-cm long ribbon. We can do this by dividing the total length of the ribbon by the length of each piece:

3,730 cm ÷ 73 cm = 51.09589...

Since we can't have a fraction of a piece of ribbon, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. This means that Sam can cut 51 pieces of ribbon that are each 73 cm long. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",51,False,False
"Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon. If each piece was 73 cm long, how much of the original ribbon was left?",7.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon. If each piece was 73 cm long, how much of the original ribbon was left?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces of ribbon Sam cut from the original ribbon. We can do this by dividing the length of the original ribbon by the length of each piece:

3,730 cm ÷ 73 cm/piece = 51 pieces

So Sam cut 51 pieces of ribbon from the original ribbon.

Next, we need to find out how much of the original ribbon was used up by these 51 pieces. Each piece is 73 cm long, so the total length of ribbon used up is:

51 pieces × 73 cm/piece = 3,723 cm

So Sam used up 3,723 cm of the original ribbon.

Finally, we can find out how much of the original ribbon was left by subtracting the length of ribbon used up from the length of the original ribbon:

3,730 cm - 3,723 cm = 7 cm

So there was 7 cm of the original ribbon left. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",7 cm.,False,False
"A tourist group has 26 people. At a hotel, they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each.

At a hotel, they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each. In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many large rooms should be rented?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many people can fit in each type of room:

- Large rooms: 3 people each
- Small rooms: 2 people each

Next, we need to figure out how many rooms we need in total to accommodate all 26 people. We can start by dividing the total number of people by the capacity of each type of room:

- Large rooms: 26 / 3 = 8.67 (rounded up to 9)
- Small rooms: 26 / 2 = 13

So we need at least 9 large rooms and 13 small rooms to accommodate all 26 people. However, we want to rent the least number of rooms possible while still having every room fully occupied. 

To do this, we can try to fill up as many large rooms as possible before resorting to small rooms. We can fill up 8 large rooms with 3 people each, which accommodates 24 people. That leaves 2 people who need a room. We can then rent 1 small room for those 2 people, which brings the total number of rooms rented to 9 (8 large rooms and 1 small room).

Therefore, the tourist group should rent 9 large rooms to accommodate all 26 people while renting the least number of rooms possible and having every room fully occupied. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9,False,False
"A tourist group has 26 people. At a hotel, they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each.

At a hotel, they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each. In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many small rooms should be rented?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many large rooms we need. We have 26 people in the group, and each large room can accommodate 3 people. So we divide 26 by 3:

26 ÷ 3 = 8 with a remainder of 2

This means we need 8 large rooms to accommodate 24 people, and we have 2 people left over. Now we need to figure out how many small rooms we need to accommodate these 2 people.

Each small room can accommodate 2 people, so we divide 2 by 2:

2 ÷ 2 = 1

This means we need 1 small room to accommodate the remaining 2 people.

Therefore, the tourist group should rent 8 large rooms and 1 small room to accommodate all 26 people with the least number of rooms and every room fully occupied. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1,True,False
"Mr. Lee harvested 495 apples and he packed them evenly in some baskets.

If there are 25 apples in each basket, how many baskets of apples are there?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each basket to find out how many baskets Mr. Lee needs:

495 ÷ 25 = 19.8

However, we can't have a fraction of a basket, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This is because we can't have a partial basket - it's either a full basket or nothing.

So, Mr. Lee needs 20 baskets of apples. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",20,False,False

If there are 25 apples in each basket, how many apples were left unpacked?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many baskets Mr. Lee used to pack all the apples. We can do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples in each basket:

495 ÷ 25 = 19.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a basket, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means Mr. Lee used 20 baskets.

Next, we can find out how many apples were packed in those 20 baskets by multiplying the number of baskets by the number of apples in each basket:

20 x 25 = 500

So Mr. Lee packed 500 apples in total. To find out how many apples were left unpacked, we can subtract the number of packed apples from the total number of apples:

495 - 500 = -5

Uh oh, we got a negative number! This means there were actually 5 fewer apples than we thought. So the answer is:

There were 5 apples left unpacked. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5,False,False

In order to make the least number of groups, how many large groups should be made?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many groups of 7 members we can make from the 90 members. We can do this by dividing 90 by 7:

90 ÷ 7 = 12 with a remainder of 6

This means we can make 12 groups of 7 members, but we will have 6 members left over.

Next, we need to figure out how many groups of 3 members we can make from the remaining 6 members. We can do this by dividing 6 by 3:

6 ÷ 3 = 2

This means we can make 2 groups of 3 members.

So, in total, we will have 12 large groups of 7 members and 2 small groups of 3 members. But we want to make the least number of groups possible, so we need to see if we can adjust the number of large groups.

If we make one less large group, we will have 7 more members left over. We can then make 2 more small groups of 3 members, which will use up 6 of those members, leaving 1 member left over. This means we will have a total of 11 large groups and 4 small groups, which is the least number of groups we can make.

Therefore, the ballet class should make 11 large groups and 4 small groups. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",11,False,False

Next, we need to figure out how many small groups of 3 members each we can make with the remaining 6 members. We can do this by dividing 6 by 3:

6 ÷ 3 = 2

So we can make 2 small groups of 3 members each.

However, we want to make the least number of groups possible. If we made 2 small groups, we would still have 4 members left over, which would require another small group. So it's actually more efficient to make 3 small groups:

If there were 65 ml of tea in each cup, how many cups were filled with tea?",16.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: There was 1,050 ml of tea in a pot. Anna poured the tea into some cups. If there were 65 ml of tea in each cup, how many cups were filled with tea?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to divide the total amount of tea (1,050 ml) by the amount of tea in each cup (65 ml):

1,050 ml ÷ 65 ml = 16.15

This means that there were 16 cups filled with tea, with some tea left over. To find out how much tea was left over, we can multiply the number of cups by the amount of tea in each cup and subtract that from the total amount of tea:

16 cups x 65 ml/cup = 1,040 ml

1,050 ml - 1,040 ml = 10 ml

So there were 16 cups filled with tea, and 10 ml of tea left over. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",16 cups.,False,False

If there were 65 ml of tea in each cup, how much tea was left in the pot?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cups Anna poured the tea into. We can do this by dividing the total amount of tea in the pot (1,050 ml) by the amount of tea in each cup (65 ml):

1,050 ml ÷ 65 ml/cup = 16.15 cups

Since we can't have a fraction of a cup, we know that Anna poured the tea into 16 cups.

Next, we need to find out how much tea was used in total. We can do this by multiplying the amount of tea in each cup (65 ml) by the number of cups used (16):

65 ml/cup x 16 cups = 1,040 ml

So, Anna used 1,040 ml of tea in total.

Finally, we can find out how much tea was left in the pot by subtracting the amount used from the total amount in the pot:

1,050 ml - 1,040 ml = 10 ml

Therefore, there was 10 ml of tea left in the pot. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10 ml.,False,False
There are 250 vitamins in a bottle. Gil takes 12 vitamins per day.

How many vitamins short of his usual 12 vitamins is Gil on the day the bottle runs out?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many days the bottle will last. We can do this by dividing the total number of vitamins in the bottle by the number of vitamins Gil takes per day:

250 vitamins ÷ 12 vitamins/day = 20.83 days

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 20 days. This means the bottle will last for 20 days if Gil takes his usual 12 vitamins per day.

Now we need to figure out how many vitamins short of his usual 12 vitamins Gil is on the day the bottle runs out. We know that the bottle lasts for 20 days, so on the 20th day, Gil will have taken:

12 vitamins/day x 20 days = 240 vitamins

This means that on the day the bottle runs out, Gil will be short:

250 vitamins - 240 vitamins = 10 vitamins

So Gil will be 10 vitamins short of his usual 12 vitamins on the day the bottle runs out. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10,False,False
"A farmer bought 164 rabbits. If the farmer wanted to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits, how many more rabbits should the farmer buy?",6.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: A farmer bought 164 rabbits. If the farmer wanted to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits, how many more rabbits should the farmer buy?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many rabbits can fit in each cage. We can do this by dividing the total number of rabbits by the number of cages:

164 rabbits ÷ 17 cages = 9.64705882 rabbits per cage

Since we can't have a fraction of a rabbit, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means each cage can hold 10 rabbits.

Now we need to figure out how many more rabbits the farmer needs to buy to fill the cages. We can do this by multiplying the number of cages by the number of rabbits per cage, and then subtracting the total number of rabbits the farmer already has:

17 cages x 10 rabbits per cage = 170 rabbits needed
170 rabbits needed - 164 rabbits already bought = 6 rabbits more needed

Therefore, the farmer needs to buy 6 more rabbits to fill the 17 cages with the same number of rabbits. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6,False,False

If all the kids share all of the lollipops equally, at least how many more lollipops are needed?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many lollipops each kid would get if they shared them equally. 

To do this, we can divide the total number of lollipops (650) by the number of kids (42): 

650 ÷ 42 = 15.48 

We can't give each kid a fraction of a lollipop, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

Therefore, each kid would get 16 lollipops. 

Now we need to find out how many lollipops we still need to distribute equally among the kids. 

To do this, we can multiply the number of kids by the number of lollipops each kid should get: 

42 x 16 = 672 

So we need at least 672 lollipops in total to distribute equally among the 42 kids. 

But we only have 650 lollipops, so we need: 

672 - 650 = 22 

At least 22 more lollipops to distribute equally among the kids. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",22,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Mrs. Dalloway made 85 tarts.
2. She wants to fill 10 boxes with the same number of tarts.
3. To find out how many tarts she needs to make, we need to divide the total number of tarts by the number of boxes: 

85 tarts ÷ 10 boxes = 8.5 tarts per box

4. Since she can't make half a tart, she needs to round up to the nearest whole number: 

8.5 tarts per box rounded up = 9 tarts per box

5. To find out how many more tarts she needs to make, we need to multiply the number of tarts per box by the number of boxes and then subtract the total number of tarts she already made: 

9 tarts per box x 10 boxes - 85 tarts = 5 more tarts

Therefore, Mrs. Dalloway needs to make 5 more tarts to fill 10 boxes with the same number of tarts. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5,False,False
"A library buys 4,305 new books. If it wants to shelve them equally onto 83 shelves, how many more new books should be purchased?",11.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: A library buys 4,305 new books. If it wants to shelve them equally onto 83 shelves, how many more new books should be purchased?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many books can be shelved on each shelf. 

To do this, we can divide the total number of books by the number of shelves: 

4,305 / 83 = 51.87 

We can't have a fraction of a book on a shelf, so we need to round down to the nearest whole number: 

51 books can be shelved on each shelf. 

Now we need to figure out how many more books are needed to fill the shelves. 

To do this, we can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books that can be shelved on each shelf: 

83 x 51 = 4,233 

This tells us that 4,233 books can be shelved on the 83 shelves. 

To find out how many more books are needed, we can subtract the number of books that can already be shelved from the total number of new books: 

4,305 - 4,233 = 72 

Therefore, the library needs to purchase 72 more new books to fill the shelves. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",72,False,False

If each office should get an equal number of bureaus, how many more bureaus are needed at least?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bureaus each office should get. To do this, we can divide the total number of bureaus (88) by the number of offices (14):

88 ÷ 14 = 6.29

Since we can't have a fraction of a bureau, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each office should get 7 bureaus.

Now we need to find out how many bureaus have already been distributed. If each office gets 7 bureaus, then the total number of bureaus distributed so far is:

14 x 7 = 98

So, 98 bureaus have already been distributed. But we only had 88 bureaus to begin with. This means we need:

98 - 88 = 10

At least 10 more bureaus to ensure that each office gets an equal number of bureaus. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10,False,False

If she wants to make 15 necklaces with each having the same number of beads, how many more beads does she need?",8.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Betty has 367 beads and wants to use all the beads to make necklaces. If she wants to make 15 necklaces with each having the same number of beads, how many more beads does she need?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Betty has 367 beads.
2. She wants to make 15 necklaces.
3. She wants each necklace to have the same number of beads.
4. Let's call the number of beads in each necklace ""x"".
5. To find out how many beads she needs in total, we can multiply the number of necklaces by the number of beads in each necklace: 15x.
6. We know that the total number of beads she has is 367, so we can set up an equation: 367 = 15x.
7. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 15: x = 24.47 (rounded to two decimal places).
8. Since we can't have a fraction of a bead, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each necklace will have 25 beads.
9. To find out how many more beads Betty needs, we can subtract the total number of beads she already has from the total number of beads she needs: 15 x 25 - 367 = 8.

"There are 315 cups of puddings to be distributed to 218 students. If each of them wants an equal number of pudding cups, at least how many more pudding cups are needed?",121.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: There are 315 cups of puddings to be distributed to 218 students. If each of them wants an equal number of pudding cups, at least how many more pudding cups are needed?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pudding cups each student can get if they are divided equally. We can do this by dividing the total number of pudding cups by the number of students:

315 cups ÷ 218 students = 1.44 cups per student (rounded to two decimal places)

Since we can't give out a fraction of a pudding cup, we need to round down to 1 cup per student. 

Now we need to find out how many pudding cups we need in total to give each student 1 cup. We can do this by multiplying the number of students by 1:

218 students × 1 cup per student = 218 cups

So we need 218 cups to give each student 1 cup of pudding. 

To find out how many more pudding cups we need, we can subtract the number of cups we have from the number of cups we need:

218 cups needed - 315 cups we have = 97 more cups needed

Therefore, we need at least 97 more pudding cups to give each of the 218 students an equal number of pudding cups. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",97,False,False
"Sam has 389 riddles for 18 of his students to guess. If he wants the students to guess the same number of riddles, at least how many more riddles does he need to distribute?",7.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Sam has 389 riddles for 18 of his students to guess. If he wants the students to guess the same number of riddles, at least how many more riddles does he need to distribute?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many riddles each student should guess. We can do this by dividing the total number of riddles by the number of students:

389 riddles ÷ 18 students = 21.61 riddles per student

Since we can't have a fraction of a riddle, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means each student should guess 22 riddles.

Now we need to find out how many riddles Sam needs to distribute in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of students by the number of riddles each student should guess:

18 students × 22 riddles per student = 396 riddles

So Sam needs to distribute at least 396 - 389 = 7 more riddles to ensure that each student can guess the same number of riddles. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",7,False,False
"A school buys 1,093 chairs. If it wants to distribute them equally into 35 classrooms, how many more chairs should be purchased?",27.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: A school buys 1,093 chairs. If it wants to distribute them equally into 35 classrooms, how many more chairs should be purchased?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many chairs each classroom will receive if they are distributed equally. 

To do this, we can divide the total number of chairs by the number of classrooms: 

1,093 ÷ 35 = 31.23 

However, we can't distribute a fraction of a chair, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

Therefore, each classroom will receive 32 chairs. 

Now we need to find out how many chairs are needed in total for all 35 classrooms: 

32 x 35 = 1,120 

So the school needs to purchase 1,120 - 1,093 = 27 more chairs. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",27,False,False
The weight of 2 bags of chips is 800 g. The total weight of 5 such bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 g. How much heavier is a bag of chips than a bottle of juice?,350.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: The weight of 2 bags of chips is 800 g. The total weight of 5 such bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 g. How much heavier is a bag of chips than a bottle of juice?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's start by finding the weight of one bag of chips. We know that the weight of 2 bags of chips is 800 g, so we can divide 800 g by 2 to get the weight of one bag: 

800 g ÷ 2 = 400 g 

Therefore, one bag of chips weighs 400 g. 

2. Now, let's find the total weight of 5 bags of chips. We know that the total weight of 5 bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 g, so we can subtract the weight of 4 bottles of juice from the total weight to get the weight of 5 bags of chips: 

2 kg 200 g - (weight of 4 bottles of juice) = weight of 5 bags of chips 

We need to convert 2 kg 200 g to grams: 

2 kg = 2000 g 

2 kg 200 g = 2000 g + 200 g = 2200 g 

Now we can substitute: 

2200 g - (weight of 4 bottles of juice) = weight of 5 bags of chips 

We don't know the weight of the bottles of juice, but we don't need to know it to solve the problem. We just need to know the weight difference between a bag of chips and a bottle of juice. 

3. Finally, let's find out how much heavier a bag of chips is than a bottle of juice. We know that the weight of one bag of chips is 400 g, so we can subtract this from the weight of one bottle of juice to get the weight difference: 

Weight of one bottle of juice - 400 g = weight difference 

We don't know the weight of one bottle of juice, but we don't need to know it to solve the problem. We just need to know the weight difference. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

A bag of chips is 400 g heavier than a bottle of juice. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",400 g.,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the weight of one diamond. We can do this by dividing the total weight of 5 diamonds (100 g) by 5:

100 g ÷ 5 = 20 g

So, one diamond weighs 20 g.

Next, we need to find the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades. We know that this total weight is 140 g. We also know that the weight of 4 diamonds is 4 x 20 g = 80 g. So, we can subtract 80 g from 140 g to find the weight of 2 jades:

140 g - 80 g = 60 g

Therefore, the weight of 2 jades is 60 g. To find the weight of one jade, we can divide this by 2:

60 g ÷ 2 = 30 g

So, one jade weighs 30 g.

Finally, we can find the difference in weight between a jade and a diamond by subtracting the weight of a diamond from the weight of a jade:

30 g - 20 g = 10 g

Therefore, a jade is 10 g heavier than a diamond. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10 g.,False,False

How much heavier is a double bed than a single bed?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the weight of a single bed. We know that the weight of 5 single beds is 50 kg, so we can divide 50 by 5 to get the weight of one single bed:

50 kg / 5 = 10 kg

So, a single bed weighs 10 kg.

Next, we need to find the weight of a double bed. We know that the total weight of 2 single beds and 4 double beds is 100 kg. Let's use this information to find the weight of a double bed:

2 single beds + 4 double beds = total weight
2(10 kg) + 4(double bed weight) = 100 kg
20 kg + 4(double bed weight) = 100 kg
4(double bed weight) = 80 kg
double bed weight = 20 kg

So, a double bed weighs 20 kg.

Finally, we can find how much heavier a double bed is than a single bed by subtracting the weight of a single bed from the weight of a double bed:

double bed weight - single bed weight = weight difference
20 kg - 10 kg = 10 kg

Therefore, a double bed is 10 kg heavier than a single bed. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10 kg.,False,False

The total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1 kg 50 g. How much heavier is a glass bottle than a plastic bottle?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's start by finding the weight of one glass bottle. We know that the weight of 3 glass bottles is 600 g, so we can divide 600 g by 3 to get the weight of one glass bottle: 

600 g ÷ 3 = 200 g 

Therefore, one glass bottle weighs 200 g. 

2. Now, let's find the total weight of all the plastic bottles. We know that the total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1 kg 50 g, which is the same as 1050 g. We also know that the weight of 3 glass bottles is 600 g, so we can subtract 600 g from 1050 g to get the weight of all the plastic bottles: 

1050 g - 600 g = 450 g 

Therefore, all the plastic bottles together weigh 450 g. 

3. Finally, we can find how much heavier a glass bottle is than a plastic bottle by subtracting the weight of one plastic bottle from the weight of one glass bottle: 

200 g - (450 g ÷ 5) = 200 g - 90 g = 110 g 

Therefore, a glass bottle is 110 g heavier than a plastic bottle. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",110 g.,False,False

If I put the same number of plants in each row and each row has only one type of plant, what is the greatest number of plants I can put in one row?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 45, 81, and 63. 

The prime factorization of 45 is 3 x 3 x 5. 
The prime factorization of 81 is 3 x 3 x 3 x 3. 
The prime factorization of 63 is 3 x 3 x 7. 

To find the GCF, we need to find the common factors and multiply them together. The only common factor is 3 x 3 = 9. 

So, we can plant 9 plants in each row. 

To check if this works, we can divide the number of plants by 9: 

45 ÷ 9 = 5 rows of sunflowers 
81 ÷ 9 = 9 rows of corn 
63 ÷ 9 = 7 rows of tomatoes 

So, we can plant 9 plants in each row for all three types of plants. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9,True,False
"A full moon occurs every 30 days. If the last full moon occurred on a Friday, how many days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a Friday?",210.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: A full moon occurs every 30 days. If the last full moon occurred on a Friday, how many days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a Friday?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. A full moon occurs every 30 days.
2. If the last full moon occurred on a Friday, the next full moon will occur 30 days later.
3. However, 30 days is not a multiple of 7 (the number of days in a week), so the day of the week will shift.
4. To figure out how many days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a Friday, we need to find the smallest multiple of 7 that is greater than 30.
5. That multiple is 35, so the next full moon will occur 35 days after the last one.
6. Since 35 is a multiple of 7, the day of the week will not shift, and the next full moon will also occur on a Friday.
7. Therefore, 35 days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a Friday. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",35,False,False

Tina had a large collection of beanie babies. She gave 8 beanie babies to her cousin. She gave half that amount to her sister. She gave 36 beanie babies to needy children. She kept 12 for herself. How many beanie babies were in Tina's collection at first?,60.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Tina had a large collection of beanie babies. She gave 8 beanie babies to her cousin. She gave half that amount to her sister. She gave 36 beanie babies to needy children. She kept 12 for herself. How many beanie babies were in Tina's collection at first?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Tina gave 8 beanie babies to her cousin, so she had (original amount - 8) left.
2. She gave half of that amount to her sister, so she gave away (original amount - 8)/2.
3. She also gave away 36 beanie babies to needy children.
4. She kept 12 for herself.
5. So, we can write an equation: 

(original amount - 8)/2 - 36 - 12 = 0

6. Simplifying the equation, we get:

(original amount - 8)/2 = 48

7. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

original amount - 8 = 96

8. Adding 8 to both sides, we get:

original amount = 104

Therefore, Tina had 104 beanie babies in her collection at first. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",104,False,False
David spent 74 cents. He bought a ruler for 29 cents and a folder for 25 cents. He also bought 2 pencils. How much does one pencil cost?,10.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: David spent 74 cents. He bought a ruler for 29 cents and a folder for 25 cents. He also bought 2 pencils. How much does one pencil cost?

A: Let's think step by step. David spent 74 cents. 

He bought a ruler for 29 cents and a folder for 25 cents. 

So far, he has spent 29 + 25 = 54 cents. 

That means he spent 74 - 54 = 20 cents on the two pencils. 

To find out how much one pencil costs, we can divide 20 by 2: 

20 ÷ 2 = 10 

Therefore, one pencil costs 10 cents. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10,False,False
Mark had 24 marbles and Evan had 3 marbles. Mark gave some of his marbles to Evan. Now Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. How many marbles did Mark give to Evan?,6.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Mark had 24 marbles and Evan had 3 marbles. Mark gave some of his marbles to Evan. Now Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. How many marbles did Mark give to Evan?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Mark had 24 marbles and Evan had 3 marbles.
2. Mark gave some of his marbles to Evan.
3. Now Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has.

Let's use algebra to solve the problem. Let's say Mark gave x marbles to Evan. After giving x marbles, Mark has 24-x marbles and Evan has 3+x marbles. According to the problem, Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. So we can write:

24-x = 2(3+x)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

24-x = 6+2x
3x = 18
x = 6

Therefore, Mark gave 6 marbles to Evan. After giving 6 marbles, Mark has 18 marbles and Evan has 9 marbles. And indeed, Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6,False,False
Annette and Caitlin weigh 95 pounds together. Caitlin and Sara weigh 87 pounds together. How much more does Annette weigh than Sara?,8.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Annette and Caitlin weigh 95 pounds together. Caitlin and Sara weigh 87 pounds together. How much more does Annette weigh than Sara?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's assign variables to the unknown weights. Let's say Annette weighs A pounds, Caitlin weighs C pounds, and Sara weighs S pounds.
2. We know that Annette and Caitlin weigh 95 pounds together, so we can write the equation A + C = 95.
3. We also know that Caitlin and Sara weigh 87 pounds together, so we can write the equation C + S = 87.
4. We want to find out how much more Annette weighs than Sara, so we need to subtract their weights. We can write this as A - S.
5. We can use the first two equations to solve for A and S in terms of C. From the first equation, we can write A = 95 - C. From the second equation, we can write S = 87 - C.
6. Now we can substitute these expressions for A and S into our expression for the difference in their weights: A - S = (95 - C) - (87 - C).
7. Simplifying this expression, we get A - S = 8.
8. So Annette weighs 8 pounds more than Sara. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8,False,False

Therefore, Kyle paid $50 for all three presents. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",$50.00 ,True,False
Three paper bags contain a total of 24 apples. The first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples. The second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples. How many apples are in the first and third bags together?,19.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Three paper bags contain a total of 24 apples. The first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples. The second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples. How many apples are in the first and third bags together?

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the number of apples in the first bag ""a"", the number of apples in the second bag ""b"", and the number of apples in the third bag ""c"". 

From the first sentence, we know that: 

a + b + c = 24 

From the second sentence, we know that: 

a + b = 11 

From the third sentence, we know that: 

b + c = 18 

Now we can use the second and third equations to solve for b: 

b + c = 18 

b = 18 - c 

Substitute this into the second equation: 

a + (18 - c) = 11 

a = -7 + c 

Now we can substitute both of these equations into the first equation: 

(-7 + c) + (18 - c) + c = 24 

Simplify: 

11 = 24

A worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep. It climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?,5.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: A worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep. It climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?

A: Let's think step by step. On the first day, the worm climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches, so it makes a net progress of 5 inches (8-3=5). 

On the second day, the worm climbs up 8 inches again, but it starts from a higher point, so it only needs to climb 26-5=21 inches to reach the top. However, it also slides back 3 inches, so its net progress is 5-3=2 inches. 

On the third day, the worm climbs up 8 inches again, but it starts from an even higher point, so it only needs to climb 21-2=19 inches to reach the top. However, it also slides back 3 inches, so its net progress is 5-3=2 inches again. 

We can continue this pattern until the worm reaches the top. Let's summarize the progress of the worm each day:

Day 1: net progress = 5 inches
Day 2: net progress = 2 inches
Day 3: net progress = 2 inches
Day 4: net progress = 2 inches
Day 5: net progress = 2 inches
...
Day n: net progress = 2 inches

We can see that the worm makes a net progress of 2 inches every day after the first day. To find out how many days it will take to reach the top, we need to divide the remaining distance (26 inches) by the net progress per day (2 inches):

26 / 2 = 13

So it will take the worm 13 days to reach the top. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",13,False,False
"Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh 90 pounds altogether. Rita and Peter know they weigh the same amount. Peter and Skeeter know they weigh 68 pounds together. How much does Skeeter weigh?",46.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh 90 pounds altogether. Rita and Peter know they weigh the same amount. Peter and Skeeter know they weigh 68 pounds together. How much does Skeeter weigh?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's call the weight of Rita and Peter ""x"". So, we know that:

Rita + Peter = x

And since they weigh the same amount, we can also say:

Rita = Peter = x/2

2. We also know that Peter and Skeeter weigh 68 pounds together. So:

Peter + Skeeter = 68

3. Now we can use the information from step 1 to substitute Peter's weight in the equation from step 2:

x/2 + Skeeter = 68

4. We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 2:

x + 2Skeeter = 136

5. We also know that the three penguins weigh 90 pounds altogether, so:

Rita + Peter + Skeeter = 90

Substituting Rita and Peter's weights from step 1:

x/2 + x/2 + Skeeter = 90

Simplifying:

x + Skeeter = 180

6. Now we have two equations with two variables:

x + 2Skeeter = 136

x + Skeeter = 180

7. We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate x:

x + 2Skeeter - (x + Skeeter) = 136 - 180

Simplifying:

Skeeter = -44

8. This doesn't make sense - Skeeter can't weigh negative pounds! So we made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

We made a mistake in step 5 - we forgot to divide 90 by 3 to get the average weight of each penguin. So the correct equation is:

x/2 + x/2 + Skeeter/3 = 30

9. Now we can substitute Peter and Rita's weights from step 1 and simplify:

x/2 + x/2 + Skeeter/3 = 30

x + Skeeter/3 = 30

x = 90 - Skeeter/3

10. Substituting x in the equation from step 2:

Peter + Skeeter = 68

x/2 + Skeeter = 68

(90 - Skeeter/3)/2 + Skeeter = 68

45 - Skeeter/6 + Skeeter = 68

5Skeeter/6 = 23

Skeeter = 138/5

11. So Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",Skeeter weighs 27.6 pounds.,False,False

Each player played 2 games with every other player, so each player played a total of 6 games (2 games with each of the other 3 players).

Step 2: How many games were played in total?

To find the total number of games played, we need to add up the number of games played by each player:

Alex played 6 games

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's start by setting up some variables:
- Let's call Megan's amount of money ""M""
- Let's call Tara's amount of money ""T""
- We know that Tara had $4 more than Megan, so we can write: T = M + 4

2. We also know that together they had enough money to buy the scooter, which cost $26. So we can write:
M + T = 26

3. Now we can substitute the expression we found for T in step 1 into the equation from step 2:
M + (M + 4) = 26

4. Simplifying the equation:
2M + 4 = 26
2M = 22
M = 11

If Heather observed the same total number of ducks and seagulls, what is the smallest number of ducks that she could have observed?",90.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Heather enjoys bird-watching and observed two types of birds traveling this season: ducks and seagulls. While the ducks traveled in flocks of 18, the seagulls traveled in flocks of 10. If Heather observed the same total number of ducks and seagulls, what is the smallest number of ducks that she could have observed?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's represent the number of ducks as ""d"" and the number of seagulls as ""s"". We know that:

- Ducks travel in flocks of 18, so the number of flocks of ducks is d/18.
- Seagulls travel in flocks of 10, so the number of flocks of seagulls is s/10.

We also know that Heather observed the same total number of ducks and seagulls, so:

- d = s

Putting all of this together, we can write an equation:

d/18 = s/10

Since we know that d = s, we can substitute:

d/18 = d/10

Now we can solve for d:

10d = 18d

8d = 0

d = 0

Uh oh, that doesn't make sense! We can't have observed zero ducks. What went wrong?

The problem is that we made an assumption when we said that the number of ducks and seagulls was the same. We don't actually know that. So let's try again, but this time we'll use a variable to represent the total number of birds that Heather observed, and we'll try to find the smallest possible value of d.

Let b be the total number of birds that Heather observed. We know that:

- The number of ducks is d, so the number of flocks of ducks is d/18.
- The number of seagulls is b - d, so the number of flocks of seagulls is (b - d)/10.

We also know that Heather observed the same total number of ducks and seagulls, so:

- d = b - d

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2d = b

Now we can substitute this into the equation for the number of flocks:

d/18 = (b - d)/10

Multiplying both sides by 90 (the least common multiple of 18 and 10), we get:

5d = 9(b - d)

Expanding the right side, we get:

5d = 9b - 9d

Simplifying, we get:

14d = 9b

Now we need to find the smallest possible value of d that satisfies this equation. The smallest possible value of b is 10 (since seagulls travel in flocks of 10), so we can try plugging in Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",14,False,False
"An event has 12 adults and 20 children. The event planner wants to make each table identical, with the same combination of adults and children and no people left over. What is the greatest number of tables the planner can set up?",4.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: An event has 12 adults and 20 children. The event planner wants to make each table identical, with the same combination of adults and children and no people left over. What is the greatest number of tables the planner can set up?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 12 and 20. 

The factors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. 

The factors of 20 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20. 

The common factors are: 1, 2, 4. 

Therefore, the GCF of 12 and 20 is 4. 

This means that we can make groups of 4 people (2 adults and 2 children) for each table. 

There are 12 adults, which means we can make 6 groups of 2 adults. 

There are 20 children, which means we can make 10 groups of 2 children. 

However, we need to make sure that we have the same number of adults and children in each group. 

The greatest number of tables we can set up is the number of groups we can make with 2 adults and 2 children. 

We can make 6 groups of 2 adults and 2 children, which means we can set up 6 tables. 

Therefore, the greatest number of tables the planner can set up is 6. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6,False,False

An employee is surprised to discover that the shop sold the same number of bars and bottles last week. What is the smallest number of each type of soap that the shop could have sold?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find two numbers that have a common factor of 5 and 19. The smallest such numbers are 95 and 380 (5 x 19 = 95 and 19 x 20 = 380).

Next, we need to divide each of these numbers by 5 and 19 to see how many boxes of each type of soap were sold. 

For 95, we get:

- 19 boxes of bars (5 bars per box)
- 5 boxes of bottles (19 bottles per box)

For 380, we get:

- 76 boxes of bars (5 bars per box)
- 20 boxes of bottles (19 bottles per box)

Since we want to find the smallest number of each type of soap that the shop could have sold, we can take the smaller of each type:

- 5 boxes of bars
- 5 boxes of bottles

Therefore, the smallest number of each type of soap that the shop could have sold is 5 boxes of bars and 5 boxes of bottles. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5 bars and 5 bottles.,False,False

How much did the cupcake cost?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Anthony gets 75 cents every day for lunch.
2. He bought a juice box for 27 cents, so he spent 27 cents.
3. He also bought a cupcake, but we don't know how much it cost yet.
4. Anthony had 8 cents left after buying the juice box and the cupcake.
5. We can use subtraction to find out how much Anthony spent on the cupcake: 

75 cents - 27 cents - cupcake cost = 8 cents 

6. We can simplify this equation by combining the known values: 

48 cents - cupcake cost = 8 cents 

7. Now we can isolate the variable (cupcake cost) by adding cupcake cost to both sides: 

48 cents - cupcake cost + cupcake cost = 8 cents + cupcake cost 

48 cents = 8 cents + cupcake cost 

8. Finally, we can solve for cupcake cost by subtracting 8 cents from both sides: 

40 cents = cupcake cost 

Therefore, the cupcake cost 40 cents. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",40,False,False

Total points for Wildcats = points in first half + points in second half

We don't know the points in the second half, so we'll use a variable to represent it. Let's call it x:

Total points for Wildcats = 36 + x

Now we need to find out how many more points the Wildcats scored than the Panthers. To do that, we subtract the Panthers' score from the Wildcats' total score:

Wildcats' lead = Total points for Wildcats - Panthers' score

We know the Wildcats scored 36 points in the first half, so their total score is 36 + x. We also know the Panthers scored 17 points. So we can substitute those values into the equation:

Wildcats' lead = (36 + x) - 17

Kira has $1.20 in quarters and dimes. She has minimized coins altogether. How many coins does she have?,6.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Kira has $1.20 in quarters and dimes. She has minimized coins altogether. How many coins does she have?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that Kira has only quarters and dimes, so we can set up two variables to represent the number of each coin: let's call the number of quarters ""q"" and the number of dimes ""d"".
2. We also know that Kira has a total of $1.20 in coins. We can use this information to set up an equation: 

0.25q + 0.10d = 1.20 

This equation represents the total value of Kira's coins in dollars. We use 0.25 for quarters and 0.10 for dimes because those are their respective values in dollars. 
3. We want to minimize the number of coins Kira has, so we can set up another equation to represent the total number of coins: 

q + d = n 

Here, ""n"" represents the total number of coins Kira has. We want to minimize this number, so we'll use it as our target variable. 
4. We can use substitution to solve for ""n"". We'll start by solving the first equation for ""d"": 

0.10d = 1.20 - 0.25q 

d = (1.20 - 0.25q) / 0.10 

5. Now we can substitute this expression for ""d"" into the second equation: 

q + (1.20 - 0.25q) / 0.10 = n 

6. We can simplify this equation by multiplying everything by 10: 

10q + 12 - 2.5q = 10n 

7. Simplifying further: 

7.5q + 12 = 10n 

8. We want to minimize ""n"", so we want to find the smallest integer value of ""n"" that satisfies this equation. We can start by trying values of ""q"" and seeing what value of ""n"" we get: 

- If q = 1, then 7.5 + 12 = 19.5, which is not an integer.

Then she filled the remaining space with 4 L of blue paint. How many milliliters of paint did Gina mix?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much paint Gina has in total. She filled up one third of the container with red paint, which means that two thirds of the container are still empty. 

So, if we let x be the total amount of paint in the container, we can write:

x = amount of red paint + amount of blue paint

We know that the amount of red paint is one third of x, so we can write:

amount of red paint = (1/3)x

And we know that the amount of blue paint is 4 L, which is the same as 4000 mL. So we can write:

amount of blue paint = 4000 mL

Putting it all together, we have:

x = (1/3)x + 4000 mL

To solve for x, we can start by subtracting (1/3)x from both sides:

(2/3)x = 4000 mL

Then we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 6000 mL

How much does he get from the 1st job if he gets per week a total of $3,875?

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the amount of money Mila's father gets from his 2nd job ""x"". 

According to the problem, his 1st job pays $375 more than his 2nd job. So, the amount of money he gets from his 1st job is:

x + $375 

Now, we know that he gets a total of $3,875 per week. This means that the amount of money he gets from both jobs combined is:

x + (x + $375) = 2x + $375 

And we also know that this total amount is $3,875. So we can set up an equation:

2x + $375 = $3,875 

Now we can solve for x:

2x = $3,500 

x = $1,750 

So Mila's father gets $1,750 from his 2nd job.

How tall is the tree?",24.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: A fence post in Tina's garden is 4 feet tall. When she measured the fence post's shadow, she found that it was 12 feet long. A tree in Tina's yard had a shadow of 72 feet. How tall is the tree?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the concept of proportions to find the height of the tree. We know that the ratio of the height of the fence post to the length of its shadow is the same as the ratio of the height of the tree to the length of its shadow. In other words:

height of fence post / length of fence post shadow = height of tree / length of tree shadow

We can plug in the values we know:

4 / 12 = height of tree / 72

Simplifying the left side:

1 / 3 = height of tree / 72

To solve for the height of the tree, we can cross-multiply:

1 x 72 = 3 x height of tree

72 = 3 height of tree

Dividing both sides by 3:

24 = height of tree

Therefore, the tree is 24 feet tall. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",24,False,False

What is the greatest number of tables the band can sell shirts from?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 20 and 8 to determine the maximum number of tables we can set up with an equal number of men's and women's shirts. 

The factors of 20 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20. 
The factors of 8 are: 1, 2, 4, 8. 

The GCF of 20 and 8 is 4. 

This means we can set up tables with 4 men's shirts and 4 women's shirts at each table. 

To find the total number of tables, we need to divide the total number of shirts by the number of shirts per table: 

Total number of men's shirts = 20 
Total number of women's shirts = 8 

Total number of shirts = 20 + 8 = 28 

Number of shirts per table = 4 men's shirts + 4 women's shirts = 8 shirts 

Number of tables = Total number of shirts ÷ Number of shirts per table 
Number of tables = 28 ÷ 8 = 3 with a remainder of 4

"Lisa is making activity baskets to donate to charity. She has 12 coloring books, 28 markers, and 36 crayons. What is the greatest number of baskets she can make if each type of toy is equally distributed among the baskets?",4.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Lisa is making activity baskets to donate to charity. She has 12 coloring books, 28 markers, and 36 crayons. What is the greatest number of baskets she can make if each type of toy is equally distributed among the baskets?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 12, 28, and 36. 

The prime factorization of 12 is 2 x 2 x 3. 
The prime factorization of 28 is 2 x 2 x 7. 
The prime factorization of 36 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 3. 

The GCF is the product of the common prime factors raised to the smallest exponent they appear in any of the numbers. In this case, the common prime factors are 2 and 3, and they appear with the smallest exponent in 2 x 2 x 3, which is 12. 

So, GCF(12, 28, 36) = 2 x 2 x 3 = 12. 

This means that Lisa can make 12 baskets, and each basket will have:

- 1 coloring book (12 ÷ 12 = 1)
- 2 markers (28 ÷ 12 = 2 with a remainder of 4, but we can't distribute fractions of markers, so we need to leave the remainder for later)
- 3 crayons (36 ÷ 12 = 3)

Now, we need to see if we can distribute the remaining 4 markers among the 12 baskets. 

If we distribute them equally, each basket would get 4 ÷ 12 = 1/3 of a marker, which is not possible. 

So, we need to distribute the remaining markers in a way that is as equal as possible. One way to do this is to give one extra marker to every third basket. This way, 4 markers will be distributed among 4 baskets, and the other 8 baskets will have 2 markers each. 

Therefore, Lisa can make 12 baskets with the following distribution of toys:

- 1 coloring book
- 2 markers (except for 4 baskets that will have 3 markers)
- 3 crayons Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",12,False,False

If there are the same number of adults as children, what is the minimum number of adults attending?",255.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: At a school event, adults are seated in groups of exactly 17 and children are seated in groups of exactly 15. If there are the same number of adults as children, what is the minimum number of adults attending?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that the number of adults is equal to the number of children.
2. We want to find the minimum number of adults attending.
3. We also know that adults are seated in groups of 17 and children are seated in groups of 15.

To find the minimum number of adults attending, we need to find the smallest number that is divisible by both 17 and 15. This is because we want to have an equal number of adults and children, and we can only have whole groups of adults and children.

The smallest number that is divisible by both 17 and 15 is their least common multiple (LCM). To find the LCM of 17 and 15, we can list their multiples and find the smallest one that they have in common:

Multiples of 17: 17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102, 119, 136, 153, 170, 187, 204, 221, 238, 255, 272, 289, 306, 323, 340, 357, 374, 391, 408, 425, 442, 459, 476, 493, 510, 527, 544, 561, 578, 595, 612, 629, 646, 663, 680, 697, 714, 731, 748, 765, 782, 799, 816, 833, 850, 867, 884, 901, 918, 935, 952, 969, 986, 1003, 1020, 1037, 1054, 1071, 1088, 1105, 1122, 1139, 1156, 1173, 1190, 1207, 1224, 1241, 1258, 1275, 1292, 1309, 1326, 1343, 1360, 1377, 1394, 1411, 1428, 1445, 1462, 1479, 1496, 1513, 1530, 1547, 1564, 1581, 1598, 1615, 1632, 1649, 1666, 168 Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","255.

"Monroe Vitamin Shop sold equal quantities of Vitamin A and Vitamin D supplements this morning, even though the Vitamin A supplements come in packs of 7 and the Vitamin D supplements in packs of 17. What is the smallest number of each type that the store could have sold?",119.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Monroe Vitamin Shop sold equal quantities of Vitamin A and Vitamin D supplements this morning, even though the Vitamin A supplements come in packs of 7 and the Vitamin D supplements in packs of 17. What is the smallest number of each type that the store could have sold?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's call the number of packs of Vitamin A supplements sold ""a"" and the number of packs of Vitamin D supplements sold ""d"".
2. We know that the store sold equal quantities of both supplements, so a = d.
3. We also know that the Vitamin A supplements come in packs of 7 and the Vitamin D supplements come in packs of 17. Therefore, the total number of Vitamin A supplements sold is 7a and the total number of Vitamin D supplements sold is 17d.
4. Since the store sold equal quantities of both supplements, we can set 7a equal to 17d: 7a = 17d.
5. To find the smallest possible values of a and d, we need to find the smallest values that satisfy the equation 7a = 17d.
6. One way to do this is to find the smallest common multiple of 7 and 17, which is 119. We can then divide 119 by 7 to get 17, and divide 119 by 17 to get 7.
7. Therefore, the smallest possible values of a and d are 17 packs of Vitamin A supplements and 7 packs of Vitamin D supplements. This means the store sold a total of 119 Vitamin A supplements and 119 Vitamin D supplements.

Amanda's band plays songs in sets of 2 and Sadie's band plays songs in sets of 9. After performing together, both bands realize that they have played the same number of songs. What is the smallest number of songs each band could have performed?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find two numbers that have a common multiple. We know that Amanda's band plays songs in sets of 2, so the number of songs they played must be an even number. Sadie's band plays songs in sets of 9, so the number of songs they played must be a multiple of 9.

Second, we need to find the smallest common multiple of these two numbers. The smallest common multiple of 2 and 9 is 18.

Third, we need to find two numbers that add up to 18. These two numbers must be the number of sets of songs each band played. We can start with 2 sets for Amanda's band and 9 sets for Sadie's band, which adds up to 11 sets. We need to add more sets to reach 18, but we want to minimize the number of sets for each band.

We can try reducing the number of sets for Sadie's band by 1 and increasing the number of sets for Amanda's band by 5. This gives us 7 sets for Sadie's band and 7 sets for Amanda's band, which adds up to 14 sets. We still need to add 4 more sets to reach 18.

We can reduce the number of sets for Sadie's band by 2 and increase the number of sets for Amanda's band by 8. This gives us 5 sets for Sadie's band and 10 sets for Amanda's band, which adds up to 15 sets. We still need to add 3 more sets to reach 18.

We can reduce the number of sets for Sadie's band by 3 and increase the number of sets for Amanda's band by 11. This gives us 2 sets for Sadie's band and 13 sets for Amanda's band, which adds up to 15 sets. We still need to add 3 more sets to reach 18.

We can reduce the number of sets for Sadie's band by 4 and increase the number of sets for Amanda's band by 14. This gives us 0 sets for Sadie's band and 16 sets for Amanda's band, which adds up to 16 sets. We still need to add 2 more sets to reach 18.

We can reduce the number of sets for Sadie's band by 5 and increase the number of sets for Amanda's band by 15. This gives us 0 sets Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","2 songs for Amanda's band and 16 songs for Sadie's band, which adds up to 18 songs in total.",False,False

Kristen notices an identical number of two types of insects in her neighborhood: butterflies and fireflies. She always seems to observe butterflies in groups of 44 and fireflies in groups of 17. What is the smallest number of butterflies that she could have seen?,748.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Kristen notices an identical number of two types of insects in her neighborhood: butterflies and fireflies. She always seems to observe butterflies in groups of 44 and fireflies in groups of 17. What is the smallest number of butterflies that she could have seen?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of both 44 and 17. This is called the least common multiple (LCM) of 44 and 17.

To find the LCM, we can list the multiples of each number and look for the smallest one that appears in both lists:

Multiples of 44: 44, 88, 132, 176, 220, 264, 308, 352, 396, 440, ...

Multiples of 17: 17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102, 119, 136, 153, 170, 187, 204, 221, 238, 255, 272, 289, 306, 323, 340, 357, 374, 391, 408, 425, 442, ...

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 748, so the LCM of 44 and 17 is 748.

This means that Kristen could have seen groups of 44 butterflies and 17 fireflies that add up to 748 insects. To find the smallest number of butterflies she could have seen, we need to divide 748 by 44 and round up to the nearest integer:

748 ÷ 44 ≈ 17.0

Rounding up, we get:

17.0 → 18

So Kristen could have seen at least 18 groups of 44 butterflies, which is equivalent to:

18 × 44 = 792 butterflies

Therefore, the smallest number of butterflies that Kristen could have seen is 792. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",792,False,False

If Linda wants to buy the same amount of each type of gum, what is the smallest number of pieces of each flavor that she must buy?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the smallest common multiple of 6 and 5, which is 30. 

This means that Linda needs to buy 30 pieces of each flavor. 

To calculate how many packs of each flavor she needs to buy, we can divide 30 by the number of pieces in each pack: 

- For strawberry gum: 30 ÷ 6 = 5 packs 
- For blueberry gum: 30 ÷ 5 = 6 packs 

So, the smallest number of pieces of each flavor that Linda must buy is 30, and she needs to buy 5 packs of strawberry gum and 6 packs of blueberry gum. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",30 pieces of each flavor.,False,False
"By coincidence, Monica's Obedience School trained the same number of dogs and cats last week. The school teaches dogs in groups of 18 and cats in groups of 3. What is the smallest number of cats the school could have had?",18.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: By coincidence, Monica's Obedience School trained the same number of dogs and cats last week. The school teaches dogs in groups of 18 and cats in groups of 3. What is the smallest number of cats the school could have had?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the school trained the same number of dogs and cats. Let's call this number ""x"". 

So, we have: 

Number of dogs = x 
Number of cats = x 

Next, we need to find the smallest number of cats the school could have had. 

We know that the school teaches cats in groups of 3. So, the number of cats must be a multiple of 3. 

To find the smallest multiple of 3 that is greater than or equal to x, we can use the ceiling function. The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer. 

So, the smallest number of cats the school could have had is: 

Ceiling(x/3) * 3 

Why do we multiply by 3 at the end? Because we want the result to be a multiple of 3. 

Let's put it all together: 

Number of dogs = x 
Number of cats = x 

Smallest number of cats = Ceiling(x/3) * 3 

Since the school trained the same number of dogs and cats, we can set these two expressions equal to each other: 

x = Ceiling(x/3) * 3 

Now we can solve for x: 

x/3 <= Ceiling(x/3) < x/3 + 1 

Multiplying both sides by 3: 

x <= 3 * Ceiling(x/3) < x + 3 

Since x is an integer, we can rewrite this as: 

x <= 3 * Ceiling(x/3) <= x + 2 

Now we can try some values of x and see what happens: 

If x = 1, then Ceiling(x/3) = 1, so the smallest number of cats is 3. 
If x = 2, then Ceiling(x/3) = 1, so the smallest number of cats is 3. 
If x = 3, then Ceiling(x/3) = 1, so the smallest number of cats is 3. 
If x = 4, then Ceiling(x/3) = 2, so the smallest number of cats is 6. 
If x = 5, then Ceiling(x/3) = 2, so the smallest number of cats is 6. 
If x = 6, then Ceiling(x/3) = 2, so the smallest number of cats is 6. 

We Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6,False,False

If the groups are both meeting in the auditorium today, then how many days from now will they next have to share the auditorium?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5, which is 15. 

This means that the drama club meets in the auditorium every 15/3 = 5 days, and the choir meets there every 15/5 = 3 days. 

Since both groups are meeting in the auditorium today, we need to find the next time that they will meet on the same day. 

The drama club will meet again in 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, and so on. 

The choir will meet again in 3 days, 6 days, 9 days, 12 days, and so on. 

The next time they will meet on the same day is in 15 days, which is the LCM of 3 and 5. 

Therefore, they will next have to share the auditorium in 15 days from today. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",15,False,False

Another day, they had lunch at tables of 8. What is the smallest number of people that could be in the group?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's consider the lunch where they sat at tables of 2. In order to fill all the tables of 2, the number of people in the group must be an even number. Let's call this number ""x"".

Next, let's consider the lunch where they sat at tables of 8. In order to fill all the tables of 8, the number of people in the group must be a multiple of 8. Let's call this number ""y"".

Now, we need to find the smallest number that satisfies both conditions. This means we need to find the smallest even number that is also a multiple of 8.

The smallest even number is 2, and the smallest multiple of 8 is 8. However, 2 is not a multiple of 8, so we need to keep going.

The next even number is 4, but this is still not a multiple of 8.

The next even number after that is 6, but this is still not a multiple of 8.

The next even number after that is 8, which is a multiple of 8. So, the smallest number of people that could be in the group is 8.

Therefore, Trent and his friends must have had lunch with 8 people. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8,False,False

During a conversation about their work, they realize that they are both walking the same total number of pets, even though Gabe walks pets in groups of 2 and Steven walks pets in groups of 10. What is the smallest total number of pets each could be walking?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Gabe walks pets in groups of 2, so the total number of pets he walks must be an even number.
2. Steven walks pets in groups of 10, so the total number of pets he walks must be a multiple of 10.
3. Since they are both walking the same total number of pets, we can set up an equation: 2x = 10y, where x is the number of groups of 2 pets Gabe walks and y is the number of groups of 10 pets Steven walks.
4. We want to find the smallest total number of pets each could be walking, so we want to find the smallest values of x and y that satisfy the equation.
5. We can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2: x = 5y.
6. This means that y must be a multiple of 1/5, since x and y must be integers. The smallest multiple of 1/5 is 1, so we can set y = 1 and solve for x: x = 5.

How many more bottles will she need to buy on the last day?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Bianca wants to drink 5 bottles of water each day.
2. She bought 47 bottles when they were on sale.
3. To figure out how many more bottles she needs to buy on the last day, we need to know how many days she has been drinking water from the 47 bottles.
4. If she has been drinking 5 bottles each day, we can divide 47 by 5 to find out how many days she has been drinking water: 

   47 ÷ 5 = 9 with a remainder of 2

   This means she has been drinking water for 9 full days and has 2 bottles left.

5. On the last day, she will need to drink 5 bottles as usual, but she only has 2 bottles left. Therefore, she will need to buy:

   5 - 2 = 3 more bottles on the last day.

So Bianca will need to buy 3 more bottles on the last day to reach her goal of drinking 5 bottles of water each day for 10 days. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3,False,False

"A movie store had 9 movies they were putting on 2 shelves. If the owner wanted to make sure each shelf had the same number of movies, how many more movies would he need?",1.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: A movie store had 9 movies they were putting on 2 shelves. If the owner wanted to make sure each shelf had the same number of movies, how many more movies would he need?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Divide the total number of movies by the number of shelves to find out how many movies should be on each shelf.

9 movies ÷ 2 shelves = 4.5 movies per shelf

Step 2: Since we can't have half a movie, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

4.5 rounded up = 5 movies per shelf

Step 3: Subtract the number of movies already on the shelves from the desired number of movies per shelf to find out how many more movies are needed.

5 movies per shelf - 4 movies already on the first shelf = 1 more movie needed

Therefore, the owner would need 1 more movie to make sure each shelf had the same number of movies. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1,False,False
"At the carnival, 6 friends bought 27 tickets. If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?",3.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: At the carnival, 6 friends bought 27 tickets. If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many tickets each friend would get if they split the 27 tickets equally.

To do this, we can divide the total number of tickets by the number of friends:

27 ÷ 6 = 4.5

Each friend would get 4.5 tickets if they split the tickets equally. However, since we can't give half a ticket to someone, we need to round this number down to 4 tickets per friend.

Step 2: Multiply the number of friends by the number of tickets each friend would get.

6 friends x 4 tickets per friend = 24 tickets

If they split the tickets equally, each friend would get 4 tickets and they would need a total of 24 tickets. However, they only have 27 tickets, which means they already have more than enough tickets to split equally.

Therefore, they don't need to buy any more tickets. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",0,False,False
An art museum had 15 pictures to split equally into 2 different exhibits.

How many more pictures would they need to make sure each exhibit had the same amount?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pictures each exhibit would have if we split the 15 pictures equally. 

To do this, we can divide 15 by 2: 

15 ÷ 2 = 7.5 

Since we can't have half a picture, we know that each exhibit would have 7 pictures. 

But we want to know how many more pictures we need to make sure each exhibit has the same amount. 

So we need to find the difference between the number of pictures we currently have (15) and the number of pictures we need for each exhibit (7): 

15 - 7 - 7 = 1 

Therefore, we need one more picture to make sure each exhibit has the same amount. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1,False,False

If they wanted to have 4 team, with the same number of students on each team, how many more students would need to sign up?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many students are on each team.
To do this, we can divide the total number of students by the number of teams:
14 students ÷ 4 teams = 3.5 students per team

Step 2: Round up to the nearest whole number.
Since we can't have half a student on a team, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means each team will have 4 students.

Step 3: Find out how many students are already on a team.
We know that each team will have 4 students, and there are already 14 students signed up. To find out how many students are already on a team, we can multiply the number of teams by the number of students per team:
4 teams x 4 students per team = 16 students

One-third of certain number added with one-fifth gives eight-fifteenth of the number. Find the number and check your calculation.,1.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: One-third of certain number added with one-fifth gives eight-fifteenth of the number. Find the number and check your calculation.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the certain number as x. 

According to the problem, 

One-third of the certain number = x/3 

One-fifth of the certain number = x/5 

Eight-fifteenth of the certain number = 8x/15 

Now, the problem says that: 

One-third of the certain number added with one-fifth gives eight-fifteenth of the number. 

So, we can write it as an equation: 

x/3 + x/5 = 8x/15 

To solve this equation, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. 

Multiplying both sides by 15, we get: 

5x + 3x = 8x 

Simplifying, we get: 

8x = 8x 

This means that x can be any number. 

Therefore, the certain number can be any multiple of 8. 

For example, if we take x = 8, then: 

One-third of 8 = 8/3 

One-fifth of 8 = 8/5 

Eight-fifteenth of 8 = 8/15 * 8 = 64/15 

Adding one-third and one-fifth, we get: 

8/3 + 8/5 = 40/15 + 24/15 = 64/15 

Which is equal to eight-fifteenth of 8. 

Hence, the certain number is 8 and the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8,False,False

If the perimeter of the building wall is 98 ft, find its length and width.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's start by assigning variables to the width and length of the building. 

Let's say that the width is ""w"" (in feet). 

According to the problem, the length is 7 feet more than the width, so we can say that the length is ""w + 7"" (in feet). 

Now we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: 

Perimeter = 2(length + width) 

We know that the perimeter is 98 feet, so we can substitute: 

98 = 2(w + 7 + w) 

Simplifying: 

98 = 2(2w + 7) 

98 = 4w + 14 

Subtracting 14 from both sides:

Find the angles of the triangle.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the first angle ""x"". 

According to the problem, the second angle is 32 degrees less than thrice the first angle. 

So, the second angle can be expressed as: 

3x - 32 

Similarly, the third angle is 28 degrees less than twice the first angle. 

So, the third angle can be expressed as: 

2x - 28 

Now, we know that the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. 

So, we can set up an equation: 

x + (3x - 32) + (2x - 28) = 180 

Simplifying this equation: 

6x - 60 = 180 

Adding 60 to both sides: 

6x = 240 

Dividing by 6: 

x = 40 

So, the first angle is 40 degrees. 

Now, we can use this value to find the other angles: 

Second angle: 3x - 32 = 3(40) - 32 = 88 degrees 

Third angle: 2x - 28 = 2(40) - 28 = 52 degrees 

Therefore, the angles of the triangle are:

The length of rectangular region is 76 ft and the side of triangular region measures 42 ft. Find the perimeter of the field.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the height of the equilateral triangle. Since the side of the triangle measures 42 ft, we can use the formula for the height of an equilateral triangle:

height = (sqrt(3)/2) x side

height = (sqrt(3)/2) x 42

height = 36.4 ft (rounded to one decimal place)

Next, we need to find the width of the rectangular region, which is also 42 ft.

Now we can find the perimeter of the field. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all sides. The equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length, so its perimeter is 3 x 42 = 126 ft. The rectangular region has two sides of length 42 ft and two sides of length 76 ft, so its perimeter is 2 x 42 + 2 x 76 = 236 ft.

Nancy did not have dessert. If each person paid 33 dollars, what was the total of the bill ?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Mary, Nancy, and Fred decided to divide the bill evenly, which means they each paid the same amount.
2. Nancy did not have dessert, so her portion of the bill would be less than Mary and Fred's portions.
3. If each person paid 33 dollars, we can set up an equation: 

    33 + 33 + 33 - Nancy's portion = total bill

4. Simplifying the equation, we get:

    99 - Nancy's portion = total bill

5. Since Nancy did not have dessert, her portion of the bill would be less than Mary and Fred's portions. Therefore, we can assume that Mary and Fred's portions were equal.
6. Let's say Mary and Fred each paid x dollars. Then, Nancy's portion would be (x - dessert cost) dollars.
7. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

    99 - (x - dessert cost) = total bill

8. Simplifying the equation, we get:

    99 - x + dessert cost = total bill

9. We don't know the exact cost of Nancy's dessert, but we do know that the total bill must be a multiple of 3 (since there were 3 people splitting it evenly). Therefore, we can try different values for dessert cost until we get a multiple of 3 for the total bill.
10. Let's try dessert cost = 6 dollars. Then, we get:

    99 - x + 6 = total bill
    105 - x = total bill

"Two boys have 480 marbles between them. One arranges them in heaps of 6 marbles and the other in heaps of 9 each. If the total number of heaps is 72, how many marbles does each have?",336.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Two boys have 480 marbles between them. One arranges them in heaps of 6 marbles and the other in heaps of 9 each. If the total number of heaps is 72, how many marbles does each have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the two boys have a total of 480 marbles between them. Let's call the number of marbles that one boy has ""x"" and the number of marbles that the other boy has ""y"". So we have:

x + y = 480

Next, we know that one boy arranges his marbles in heaps of 6 and the other arranges his marbles in heaps of 9. Let's call the number of heaps that the first boy makes ""a"" and the number of heaps that the second boy makes ""b"". So we have:

6a = x
9b = y

And we also know that the total number of heaps is 72. So we have:

a + b = 72

Now we can use these equations to solve for x and y. First, we can substitute 6a for x and 9b for y in the equation x + y = 480:

6a + 9b = 480

Next, we can use the equation a + b = 72 to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Let's solve for b:

b = 72 - a

Now we can substitute 72 - a for b in the equation 6a + 9b = 480:

6a + 9(72 - a) = 480

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3a = 144

a = 48

So the first boy made 48 heaps of 6 marbles, which means he has 6a = 288 marbles. And the second boy made 72 - 48 = 24 heaps of 9 marbles, which means he has 9b = 216 marbles.

Therefore, the first boy has 288 marbles and the second boy has 216 marbles. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",288 and 216.,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume Jacob's present age as x. 

According to the problem, Jacob's father's present age is three times that of Jacob. 

So, Jacob's father's present age = 3x. 

After 5 years, Jacob's age would be x+5 and his father's age would be 3x+5. 

The problem also states that the sum of their ages after 5 years would be 70 years. 

So, (x+5) + (3x+5) = 70 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4x + 10 = 70 

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 4x = 60 

Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 15 

So, Jacob's present age is 15 years. 

And, Jacob's father's present age is 3x = 3(15) = 45 years. 

Therefore, Jacob is 15 years old and his father is 45 years old. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",15 and 45.,False,False
"Length of a rectangle is 8 m less than twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 56 m, find its length and width.",16.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Length of a rectangle is 8 m less than twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 56 m, find its length and width.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's start by assigning variables to the length and width of the rectangle. 

Let's say that the width is ""w"" meters. 

According to the problem, the length is ""8 m less than twice its width"". 

So, the length can be represented as: 

length = 2w - 8 

Now, we know that the perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. 

For this rectangle, the perimeter is given as 56 m. 

So, we can set up an equation: 

perimeter = 2(length + width) 

56 = 2(2w - 8 + w) 

Simplifying this equation: 

56 = 2(3w - 8) 

28 = 3w - 8 

36 = 3w 

w = 12 

Now that we know the width is 12 meters, we can use the equation for the length: 

length = 2w - 8 

length = 2(12) - 8 

length = 16 

Therefore, the length of the rectangle is 16 meters and the width is 12 meters. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",length = 16 m and width = 12 m.,False,False
"Five years hence, the age of Jacob will be three times that of his son. Five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son. What are their present ages?",40.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Five years hence, the age of Jacob will be three times that of his son. Five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son. What are their present ages?

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume Jacob's current age is J and his son's current age is S. 

According to the first statement, ""Five years hence, the age of Jacob will be three times that of his son."" 

So, in 5 years, Jacob's age will be J+5 and his son's age will be S+5. 

And we know that J+5 = 3(S+5) 

Expanding the equation, we get J+5 = 3S+15 

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get J-10 = 3S 

This is our first equation. 

Now, let's look at the second statement, ""Five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son."" 

So, 5 years ago, Jacob's age was J-5 and his son's age was S-5. 

And we know that J-5 = 7(S-5) 

Expanding the equation, we get J-5 = 7S-35 

Adding 35 to both sides, we get J+30 = 7S 

This is our second equation. 

Now, we have two equations: 

J-10 = 3S 

J+30 = 7S 

We can solve for J and S by using substitution or elimination method. 

Let's use substitution method. 

From the first equation, we can write J = 3S+10 

Substituting this value of J in the second equation, we get: 

3S+10+30 = 7S 

Solving for S, we get S = 10 

Substituting this value of S in the first equation, we get: 

J-10 = 3(10) 

Solving for J, we get J = 40 

Therefore, Jacob's current age is 40 and his son's current age is 10. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",Jacob is 40 years old and his son is 10 years old.,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the current age of the son is x. 

Five years ago, the age of the father was three times the age of the son. 

So, the father's age five years ago was 3x. 

Now, we need to find the current age of the father. 

So, the current age of the father would be 3x + 5 (adding 5 years to the age five years ago). 

Ten years later, the father's age would be 3x + 5 + 10 = 3x + 15. 

And the son's age would be x + 10 (adding 10 years to the current age). 

According to the problem, the father's age ten years later would be twice the son's age. 

So, we can write the equation: 

3x + 15 = 2(x + 10) 

Simplifying the equation: 

3x + 15 = 2x + 20 

x = 5 

So, the current age of the son is 5 years old. 

And the current age of the father is 3x + 5 = 20 years old. 

Therefore, the son is 5 years old and the father is 20 years old. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5 and 20.,False,False
A is two years older than B. A's father D is twice as old as A and B is twice old as his sister C. The ages of D and C differ by 40 years. Find the ages of A and B.,26.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: A is two years older than B. A's father D is twice as old as A and B is twice old as his sister C. The ages of D and C differ by 40 years. Find the ages of A and B.

A: Let's think step by step. 1. A is two years older than B. Let's represent B's age as x. Then A's age would be x+2.
2. A's father D is twice as old as A. So, if A is represented as x+2, then D's age would be 2(x+2) = 2x+4.
3. B is twice old as his sister C. Let's represent C's age as y. Then B's age would be 2y.
4. The ages of D and C differ by 40 years. So, 2x+4 - y = 40.
5. We can simplify this equation by substituting y with 2y (from step 3). So, 2x+4 - 2y = 40.
6. We can simplify further by dividing both sides by 2. So, x+2 - y = 20.
7. Now we have two equations: x+2 = A's age and x+2 - y = 20. We can use these equations to solve for x and y.
8. Let's rearrange the second equation to get y in terms of x: y = x+2-20 = x-18.
9. Now we can substitute y with x-18 in the second equation: x+2 - (x-18) = 20.
10. Simplifying this equation, we get x = 18.
11. So, B's age is x = 18 and A's age is x+2 = 20. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",A is 20 years old and B is 18 years old.,False,False
"Two years ago, a father was five times as old as his son. Two years later, his age will be 8 more than the age of the son.

Find the present ages of father and son.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the present age of the son is x. 

Two years ago, the age of the father was five times as old as his son, which means: 

Father's age two years ago = 5(x-2) 

Now, we need to find the present age of the father. 

Present age of the father = Father's age two years ago + 2 

Present age of the father = 5(x-2) + 2 

Present age of the father = 5x - 8 

We also know that two years later, the father's age will be 8 more than the age of the son. 

Father's age two years later = x + 8 

Present age of the father + 2 = x + 8 

5x - 8 + 2 = x + 8 

4x = 14 

x = 3.5 

Since we cannot have a half age, we can assume that the son is 4 years old. 

Present age of the son = x = 4 

Present age of the father = 5x - 8 = 12 + 2 = 14 

Therefore, the present ages of the father and son are 14 and 4, respectively. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",14 and 4.,False,False
Father's age is three times the sum of the ages of his two children. After 5 years his age will be twice the sum of age of two children.

Find the age of father.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the age of one child to be x and the age of the other child to be y. 

According to the problem, 

Father's age = 3(x+y) 

After 5 years, 

Father's age = 2[(x+5) + (y+5)] 

Now we can simplify these equations: 

3(x+y) = Father's age 

2[(x+5) + (y+5)] = Father's age 

We can equate these two equations: 

3(x+y) = 2[(x+5) + (y+5)] 

3x + 3y = 2x + 2y + 20 

x + y = 20 

Now we know that the sum of the ages of the two children is 20. 

We can substitute this value in the first equation: 

Father's age = 3(x+y) 

Father's age = 3(20) 

Father's age = 60 

Therefore, the age of the father is 60 years. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",60,False,False
5 years hence the age of a father shall be three times the age of his son while 5 years earlier the age of father was 7 times the age of his son.

Find the present ages.

A: Let's think step by step. Let the present age of the father be F and the present age of the son be S.

5 years hence, the age of the father shall be F + 5 and the age of the son shall be S + 5.

According to the problem, 5 years hence the age of the father shall be three times the age of his son. So we can write:

F + 5 = 3(S + 5)

Expanding the brackets, we get:

F + 5 = 3S + 15

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get:

F = 3S + 10

Now let's consider the second part of the problem. 5 years earlier, the age of the father was F - 5 and the age of the son was S - 5.

According to the problem, 5 years earlier the age of father was 7 times the age of his son. So we can write:

F - 5 = 7(S - 5)

Expanding the brackets, we get:

F - 5 = 7S - 35

Adding 5 to both sides, we get:

F = 7S - 30

Now we have two equations for F in terms of S:

F = 3S + 10

F = 7S - 30

We can equate these two equations to get:

3S + 10 = 7S - 30

Subtracting 3S from both sides, we get:

10 = 4S - 30

Adding 30 to both sides, we get:

40 = 4S

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

S = 10

Now we can substitute S = 10 into either of the equations for F to get:

F = 3S + 10 = 3(10) + 10 = 40

Therefore, the present age of the father is 40 and the present age of the son is 10. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","Father's age = 40

F = C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5  (equation 1) 

After 15 years, the ages of the children will increase by 15, and the age of the father will increase by 15 as well. So, we can write: 

2(F+15) = (C1+15) + (C2+15) + (C3+15) + (C4+15) + (C5+15) 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

2F + 30 = C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 + 75 

Using equation 1, we can substitute F with the sum of the ages of the children: 

2(C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5) + 30 = C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 + 75 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 = 22.5 

But this doesn't make sense, as the ages of the children cannot be fractions. 

Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",not possible to determine.,False,False
"Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age. One son is two years older than the other and sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. Find the present ages of all.",21.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age. One son is two years older than the other and sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. Find the present ages of all.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns. 

Let x be the age of the younger son. 

Then, the age of the older son is x + 2 (as given in the problem). 

Let y be the age of the father. 

Now, let's use the information given in the problem to form equations. 

Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of the two sons was one-third of their father's age. 

Ten years ago, the younger son's age was x - 10, and the older son's age was x + 2 - 10 = x - 8. 

So, we can write: 

(x - 10) + (x - 8) = (1/3)(y - 10) 

Simplifying this equation: 

2x - 18 = (1/3)y - 10 

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 

6x - 54 = y - 30 

y = 6x + 24 

Now, let's use the second piece of information given in the problem: 

The sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. 

The sum of their present ages is x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2. 

The father's present age is y. 

So, we can write: 

2x + 2 = y - 14 

Substituting y = 6x + 24: 

2x + 2 = 6x + 24 - 14 

2x + 2 = 6x + 10 

-4x = -8 

x = 2 

So, the younger son's age is x = 2. 

The older son's age is x + 2 = 4. 

And, y = 6x + 24 = 36. 

Therefore, the present ages of the younger son, older son, and father are 2, 4, and 36, respectively. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","2, 4, and 36.",False,False
"If twice the son's age is added to the father's, the sum is 70. But if twice the father's age is added to the son's age, the sum is 95.

But if twice the father's age is added to the son's age, the sum is 95. Find the ages of father and son.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the son's age is x and the father's age is y. 

According to the first condition, ""twice the son's age is added to the father's, the sum is 70"": 

2x + y = 70 

According to the second condition, ""twice the father's age is added to the son's age, the sum is 95"": 

x + 2y = 95 

Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for x and y using substitution or elimination. 

Let's use substitution: 

From the first equation, we can solve for y: 

y = 70 - 2x 

Substitute this into the second equation: 

x + 2(70 - 2x) = 95 

Simplify and solve for x: 

x + 140 - 4x = 95 

-3x = -45 

x = 15 

Now we can use either equation to solve for y: 

2x + y = 70 

2(15) + y = 70 

y = 40 

Therefore, the son is 15 years old and the father is 40 years old. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","Son: 15 years old
Father: 40 years old",False,False
"I am three times as old as my son. Five years later, I shall be two and a half times as old as my son. How old am I and how old is my son?",45.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: I am three times as old as my son. Five years later, I shall be two and a half times as old as my son. How old am I and how old is my son?

A: Let's think step by step. Let's say the age of the son is x. 

According to the problem, the age of the parent is three times the age of the son, so the age of the parent is 3x. 

Five years later, the age of the son will be x+5, and the age of the parent will be 3x+5. 

The problem also states that five years later, the parent will be two and a half times as old as the son, so we can set up an equation: 

3x+5 = 2.5(x+5) 

Simplifying this equation: 

3x+5 = 2.5x+12.5 

0.5x = 7.5 

x = 15 

So the son is 15 years old. 

To find the age of the parent, we can use the equation we set up earlier: 

3x = 3(15) = 45 

So the parent is 45 years old. 

Therefore, the parent is 45 years old and the son is 15 years old. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",45 years old and 15 years old.,False,False
The sum total of the ages of father and the son is 55 years. If the father was to live till his son's age equals his present age. The total of their ages would be 93 years. Find their present ages.,37.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: The sum total of the ages of father and the son is 55 years. If the father was to live till his son's age equals his present age. The total of their ages would be 93 years. Find their present ages.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the father's age is x and the son's age is y. 

From the first statement, we know that: 

x + y = 55 

From the second statement, we know that if the father lives until his son's age equals his present age, then: 

y + (y - x) = 93 

Simplifying this equation: 

2y - x = 93 

Now we have two equations with two variables: 

x + y = 55 

2y - x = 93 

We can solve for x in the first equation: 

x = 55 - y 

Substituting this into the second equation: 

2y - (55 - y) = 93 

Simplifying: 

3y = 148 

y = 49.33 

Since the son's age must be a whole number, we can round up to 50. 

Substituting y = 50 into the first equation: 

x + 50 = 55 

x = 5 

Therefore, the father's age is 5 and the son's age is 50. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5 and 50.,False,False

Anna's father Denver is twice as old as Anna and Ben is twice as old as his sister Cathy. The ages of Cathy and Denver differ by 30 years. Find the ages of Anna and Ben.

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's start by assigning variables to the unknown ages. Let A be Anna's age and B be Ben's age.
2. We know that A and B differ by 3 years, so we can write: B = A + 3.
3. We also know that Denver is twice as old as Anna, so we can write: D = 2A.
4. We know that Ben is twice as old as Cathy, so we can write: B = 2C.
5. Finally, we know that Denver's age differs from Cathy's age by 30 years, so we can write: D - C = 30.
6. Now we can use these equations to solve for A and B. First, we can substitute B = A + 3 into the equation B = 2C to get: A + 3 = 2C.
7. We can also substitute D = 2A into the equation D - C = 30 to get: 2A - C = 30.
8. Now we have two equations with two unknowns (A and C). We can solve for C in terms of A by rearranging the first equation: C = (A + 3)/2.
9. Substituting this into the second equation, we get: 2A - (A + 3)/2 = 30.
10. Solving for A, we get: A = 21.

"Five years ago, Nancy was thrice as old as Sam. Ten years later, Nancy will be twice as old as Sam. How old are Nancy and Sam?",50.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Five years ago, Nancy was thrice as old as Sam. Ten years later, Nancy will be twice as old as Sam. How old are Nancy and Sam?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Five years ago, Nancy was thrice as old as Sam.
Let's assume Nancy's current age is N and Sam's current age is S.
So, five years ago, Nancy's age was N-5 and Sam's age was S-5.
According to the given condition, N-5 = 3(S-5).
Simplifying this equation, we get N = 3S - 10.

2. Ten years later, Nancy will be twice as old as Sam.
In ten years, Nancy's age will be N+10 and Sam's age will be S+10.
According to the given condition, N+10 = 2(S+10).
Simplifying this equation, we get N = 2S + 10.

Now we have two equations for N in terms of S:
N = 3S - 10 and N = 2S + 10.

Equating these two equations, we get:
3S - 10 = 2S + 10
Solving for S, we get S = 20.

Substituting this value of S in either of the equations for N, we get:
N = 3S - 10 = 3(20) - 10 = 50.

Therefore, Nancy is 50 years old and Sam is 20 years old. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",Nancy is 50 years old and Sam is 20 years old.,False,False
Seven times a two digit is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits and the sum of the digits is 3. Find the number.,12.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Seven times a two digit is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits and the sum of the digits is 3. Find the number.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the tens digit of the number ""x"" and the ones digit ""y"". 

From the problem, we know that: 

- Seven times the number is 7(10x + y) 
- The number obtained by reversing the order of digits is 10y + x 
- Four times the reversed number is 4(10y + x) 

So we can set up the equation: 

7(10x + y) = 4(10y + x) 

Expanding and simplifying: 

70x + 7y = 40y + 4x 

66x = 33y 

Dividing both sides by 33: 

2x = y 

We also know that the sum of the digits is 3: 

x + y = 3 

Substituting y with 2x: 

x + 2x = 3 

3x = 3 

x = 1 

So the tens digit is 1, and the ones digit is 2x = 2(1) = 2. 

Therefore, the number is 12. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",12,True,False
A two digit number is four times the sum of its digits and twice the product of the digits. Find the number.,36.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: A two digit number is four times the sum of its digits and twice the product of the digits. Find the number.

A: Let's think step by step. Let the two-digit number be represented by the digits $a$ and $b$, where $a$ is the tens digit and $b$ is the units digit. Then we can write the number as $10a+b$. 

We are given that this number is four times the sum of its digits, which is $a+b$, so we can write:

$$10a+b=4(a+b)$$

We are also given that the number is twice the product of its digits, which is $ab$, so we can write:

$$10a+b=2ab$$

Now we have two equations with two variables, so we can solve for $a$ and $b$. Let's start by simplifying the first equation:

$$10a+b=4a+4b$$
$$6a=3b$$
$$2a=b$$

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

$$10a+2a=2a\cdot a$$
$$12a=2a^2$$
$$6a=a^2$$
$$a=6$$

Substituting this back into $2a=b$, we get $b=12$. However, this is not a valid digit for the units place, so we must discard it. 

Therefore, there is no two-digit number that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",$\boxed{\text{N/A}}$.,False,False

Find the number.

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's represent the number as ""10a + b"" where a and b are the digits. 

According to the problem, we know that: 

10a + b = 7(a + b) 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

3a = 2b 

This means that a must be an even number and b must be a multiple of 3. The only possible values for a and b are 2 and 6, respectively. 

So the number is 26. 

Now, we need to check if the second condition is satisfied: 

When 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. 

26 - 27 = -1, which is not a two-digit number. 

Therefore, there is no solution that satisfies both conditions. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",N/A.,False,False
"In a two digit number, the sum of the two digits is 9. If the digits are reversed , the number is increased by 9. Find the number.",45.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: In a two digit number, the sum of the two digits is 9. If the digits are reversed , the number is increased by 9. Find the number.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the tens digit ""x"" and the ones digit ""y"". 

From the first sentence, we know that: 

x + y = 9 

From the second sentence, we know that if we reverse the digits, the number is increased by 9. So, if the original number is 10x + y, the reversed number is 10y + x, and we have: 

10y + x = 10x + y + 9 

Simplifying this equation: 

9y - 9x = 9 

y - x = 1 

Now we have two equations: 

x + y = 9 

y - x = 1 

We can solve for x and y by adding these two equations: 

2y = 10 

y = 5 

Then, we can substitute y = 5 into one of the equations to solve for x: 

x + 5 = 9 

x = 4 

So the original number is 45. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",45,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's call the two-digit number ""10a + b"", where a and b are the tens and ones digits, respectively.
2. We know that a + b = 15, so we can solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Let's solve for b: b = 15 - a.
3. We also know that when we decrease the number by 27 and reverse the digits, we get a new number. This means that (10a + b) - 27 = 10b + a.
4. Substituting b = 15 - a from step 2, we get: 10a + (15 - a) - 27 = 10(15 - a) + a.

Find the number.",93.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: In a two digit number, the tens digit is three times the unit digit. When the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed. Find the number.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the tens digit ""t"" and the units digit ""u"". 

From the first sentence, we know that: 

t = 3u 

This means that the tens digit is three times the units digit. 

Now, let's think about the second sentence: 

""When the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed."" 

This means that if we subtract 54 from the original number, we get a new number where the digits are reversed. 

For example, if the original number was 42, then the new number would be 24 (42 - 54 = 24). 

So, we can set up an equation: 

10t + u - 54 = 10u + t 

We use 10t and 10u because we're dealing with a two-digit number. 

Now, we can substitute t = 3u (from the first sentence) into the equation: 

10(3u) + u - 54 = 10u + 3u 

Simplifying: 

30u + u - 54 = 13u 

31u - 54 = 13u 

18u = 54 

u = 3 

So, the units digit is 3. 

Now, we can use t = 3u to find the tens digit: 

t = 3u = 3(3) = 9 

So, the tens digit is 9. 

Therefore, the original number is 93. 

To check, we can subtract 54 from 93: 

93 - 54 = 39 

And we see that the digits are indeed reversed. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",93,False,False

From the first condition, we know that: 

x + y = 8 

From the second condition, we know that: 

10x + y - (10y + x) = 18 

Simplifying this equation: 

9x - 9y = 18 

Dividing both sides by 9: 

x - y = 2 

Now we have two equations: 

x + y = 8 

x - y = 2 

Adding these equations together, we get: 

2x = 10 

x = 5 

Substituting x = 5 into either equation, we get:

In 13 hours, it can go 40 km upstream and 55 km downstream. Determine the speed of the stream and that of boat in still water.

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's assume the speed of the boat in still water as ""b"" and the speed of the stream as ""s"".
2. According to the problem, the boat goes 30 km upstream and 44 km downstream in 10 hours. We can use the formula: distance = speed x time.
   - For upstream: (b - s) x 10 = 30
   - For downstream: (b + s) x 10 = 44
3. We can simplify these equations:
   - b - s = 3  (equation 1)
   - b + s = 4.4 (equation 2)
4. We can solve these equations by adding them:
   - 2b = 7.4
   - b = 3.7
5. Now, we can find the speed of the stream by substituting b = 3.7 into equation 1:
   - 3.7 - s = 3
   - s = 0.7

Find her speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the speed of Tara's rowing in still water ""x"" and the speed of the current ""y"". 

When Tara rows downstream, her effective speed is the sum of her rowing speed and the speed of the current, so: 

x + y = 20/2 

Simplifying: 

x + y = 10 

When Tara rows upstream, her effective speed is the difference between her rowing speed and the speed of the current, so: 

x - y = 4/2 

Simplifying: 

x - y = 2 

Now we have two equations with two variables: 

x + y = 10 

x - y = 2 

We can solve for one variable in terms of the other by adding or subtracting the equations: 

2x = 12 

x = 6 

Now we know that Tara's speed of rowing in still water is 6 km/h. We can substitute this value into one of the equations to solve for the speed of the current: 

6 + y = 10 

y = 4 

So the speed of the current is 4 km/h. 

Therefore, Tara's speed of rowing in still water is 6 km/h and the speed of the current is 4 km/h. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6 km/h and 4 km/h.,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's start by defining some variables:
- Let's call the speed of the sailor in still water ""s"" (in km/h).
- Let's call the speed of the current ""c"" (in km/h).

2. We know that the distance the sailor covers downstream is 8 km. We also know that he does this in 40 minutes, which is 2/3 of an hour. Therefore, we can use the formula:

distance = speed x time

to write:

8 = (s + c) x (2/3)

3. We also know that the sailor covers the same distance upstream (i.e. 8 km), but this time it takes him 1 hour. Therefore, we can use the same formula to write:

8 = (s - c) x 1

4. We now have two equations with two unknowns (s and c). We can solve this system of equations by using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

- From equation 1, we can isolate s:

s = (8/(2/3)) - c
s = 12 - 1.5c

- We can substitute this expression for s in equation 2:

8 = (12 - 1.5c) - c

5. We can now solve for c:

8 = 10.5 - 2.5c
2.5c = 2.5
c = 1

6. We can now use this value of c to find s:

s = 12 - 1.5c
s = 12 - 1.5(1)
s = 10.5

Therefore, the speed of the sailor in still water is 10.5 km/h and the speed of the current is 1 km/h. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10.5 km/h for the speed of the sailor in still water and 1 km/h for the speed of the current.,False,False

If they travel in the same direction, they meet in 7 hours, but if they travel towards each other they meet in one hour. What are their respective speeds?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the speed of the car starting from A is x km/h and the speed of the car starting from B is y km/h.

When they travel in the same direction, their relative speed is (x-y) km/h (since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract their speeds). We know that they meet in 7 hours, so we can use the formula:

distance = speed x time

The distance they cover when they travel in the same direction is 70 km (since they are going from A to B). Therefore, we can write:

70 = (x-y) x 7

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x - y = 10

Now let's consider the case when they travel towards each other. In this case, their relative speed is (x+y) km/h (since they are moving towards each other, we add their speeds). We know that they meet in 1 hour, so we can use the same formula:

distance = speed x time

The distance they cover when they travel towards each other is also 70 km (since they are still going from A to B). Therefore, we can write:

70 = (x+y) x 1

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x + y = 70

Now we have two equations:

x - y = 10
x + y = 70

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y. Adding the two equations, we get:

2x = 80

Therefore, x = 40 km/h. Substituting this value in one of the equations, we get:

y = 30 km/h

But if he travels 260 km by train and 240 km by taxi he takes 6 minutes longer. Find the speed of train and taxi.

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let's assume the speed of the train as x km/h and the speed of the taxi as y km/h.

Step 2: We know that Amy travelled 300 km by train and 200 km by taxi, and it took him 5 hours 30 minutes. Using the formula distance = speed x time, we can write two equations:

300 = x(t1)   (equation 1)
200 = y(t1)   (equation 2)
5.5 = t1      (equation 3)

where t1 is the time taken by Amy to travel 300 km by train and 200 km by taxi.

Step 3: We also know that if Amy travels 260 km by train and 240 km by taxi, he takes 6 minutes longer. Using the same formula, we can write two more equations:

260 = x(t2)   (equation 4)
240 = y(t2)   (equation 5)
5.5 + 0.1 = t2 (equation 6)

where t2 is the time taken by Amy to travel 260 km by train and 240 km by taxi.

Note: We added 0.1 to equation 6 because 6 minutes is equal to 0.1 hours.

Step 4: Now we have 6 equations (equations 1 to 6) and 6 variables (x, y, t1, t2). We need to solve these equations to find the values of x and y.

Step 5: We can use equations 1 and 4 to eliminate t1 and t2. Subtracting equation 4 from equation 1, we get:

40 = x(0.1)   (equation 7)

Dividing equation 1 by equation 7, we get:

7.5 = t1

Substituting t1 = 7.5 in equation 3, we get:

x = 60

Step 6: Now we can use equation 2 to find the value of y:

200 = y(7.5)
y = 26.67

Step 7: Finally, we can check if our solution is correct by using equations 5 and 6:

240 = 26.67(t2)
260 = 60(t2)
t2 = 4.1

5.5 + 0.1 = Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",60 km/h for the train and 26.67 km/h for the taxi.,False,False

Find the speed of train and that of car.

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let's assume the speed of the train as x km/h and the speed of the car as y km/h.

Step 2: We know that the man travels 400 km by train and the rest by car, taking 6 hours and 30 minutes. We can write this as:

400/x + 200/y = 6.5

Step 3: We also know that if the man travels 200 km by train and the rest by car, he takes 30 minutes longer. We can write this as:

200/x + 400/y = 7

Step 4: We have two equations with two variables. We can solve them simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

Multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting the second equation from it, we get:

(800/x + 400/y) - (200/x + 400/y) = 13 - 7.5

Simplifying, we get:

For a journey of 10 km, the charge paid is $75 and for a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is $110. What will a person have to pay for traveling a distance of 25 km?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the variable charge per km. We can do this by finding the difference in charges for the two given distances:

Charge for 15 km - Charge for 10 km = $110 - $75 = $35

So, the variable charge per km is:

$35 / 5 km = $7/km

Next, we need to find the fixed charge. We can do this by substituting one of the given distances and charges into the formula:

Charge = Fixed charge + Variable charge per km x Distance

Using the journey of 10 km:

$75 = Fixed charge + $7/km x 10 km

$75 = Fixed charge + $70

Fixed charge = $5

Now we have both the fixed charge and the variable charge per km, so we can find the charge for a journey of 25 km:

Charge = Fixed charge + Variable charge per km x Distance

Charge = $5 + $7/km x 25 km

Charge = $5 + $175

Charge = $180

Therefore, a person will have to pay $180 for traveling a distance of 25 km. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",$180.00 ,False,False

One reserved first class from Michigan to Massachusetts costs $216 and one full and one half reserved first class tickets cost $327. What is the basic first class full fare and what is the reservation charge?

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the basic first class full fare is x and the reservation charge is y. 

From the first piece of information, we know that: 

- Half ticket = 1/2 x 
- Reservation charge on half ticket = Reservation charge on full ticket = y 

From the second piece of information, we know that: 

- Full ticket + Half ticket = $327 
- Reservation charge on full ticket + Reservation charge on half ticket = 2y 

We can simplify the second equation by substituting the first equation: 

- Reservation charge on full ticket + y = 2y 
- Reservation charge on full ticket = y 

Now we can solve for x: 

- Full ticket + Half ticket = $327 
- Full ticket + 1/2 x = $327 
- Full ticket = $327 - 1/2 x 

We can substitute this into the equation for the first class full fare: 

- x + y = $216 
- ($327 - 1/2 x) + y = $216 
- $327 + y - 1/2 x = $216 
- y - 1/2 x = -$111 

We have two equations with two variables: 

- y = x/2 
- y - 1/2 x = -$111 

We can substitute the first equation into the second: 

- x/2 - 1/2 x = -$111 
- -1/2 x = -$111 
- x = $222 

So the basic first class full fare is $222. 

We can substitute this into the equation for y: 

- y = x/2 
- y = $111 

So the reservation charge is $111. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",$222 for the basic first class full fare and $111 for the reservation charge.,False,False
"A man walks certain distance with certain speed. If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less. But if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. Find the distance covered by the man and his original rate of walking.",36.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: A man walks certain distance with certain speed. If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less. But if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. Find the distance covered by the man and his original rate of walking.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the distance covered by the man is ""d"" km and his original speed is ""s"" km/hr.

According to the problem, if he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less. This means that:

d/s - d/(s+1/2) = 1

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2d/(2s+1) = 1

2d = 2s + 1

d = (s + 1/2)

Similarly, if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. This means that:

d/s - d/(s-1) = 3

Simplifying this equation, we get:

d = 3s - 3

Now we can substitute the value of ""d"" from the first equation into the second equation:

s + 1/2 = 3s - 3

2s = 7/2

s = 7/4

Therefore, the original speed of the man is 7/4 km/hr and the distance covered by him is:

d = s + 1/2 = 7/4 + 1/2 = 15/4 km

So, the man covered a distance of 15/4 km at a speed of 7/4 km/hr. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",15/4 km at 7/4 km/hr.,False,False
A car goes uphill at the rate of 30 km an hour and downhill at the rate of 50 km an hour after 15 hours it has covered 650 km. How long did it go downhill and uphill respectively?,5.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: A car goes uphill at the rate of 30 km an hour and downhill at the rate of 50 km an hour after 15 hours it has covered 650 km. How long did it go downhill and uphill respectively?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the car went uphill for x hours and downhill for y hours. 

Then, we can use the formula: 

distance = rate x time 

For the uphill part, the distance covered would be: 

30x 

For the downhill part, the distance covered would be: 

50y 

And we know that the total distance covered is 650 km. So we can write: 

30x + 50y = 650 

Now we need another equation to solve for x and y. We know that the car traveled for a total of 15 hours, so: 

x + y = 15 

We have two equations with two variables, so we can solve for x and y. 

First, let's solve for y in terms of x: 

y = 15 - x 

Substitute this into the first equation: 

30x + 50(15 - x) = 650 

Simplify: 

30x + 750 - 50x = 650 

-20x = -100 

x = 5 

So the car went uphill for 5 hours. 

To find y, we can use the equation we derived earlier: 

y = 15 - x 

y = 15 - 5 

y = 10 

So the car went downhill for 10 hours. 

Therefore, the car went uphill for 5 hours and downhill for 10 hours. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5 hours uphill and 10 hours downhill.,False,False

Find the speed of the train and bus separately.

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Let's assume the speed of the train as x km/h and the speed of the bus as y km/h.

Step 2: According to the problem, Ronnie travels 60 km by train and the remaining by bus. So, the time taken for the train journey is:

60/x hours

Step 3: The distance covered by the bus is:

300 - 60 = 240 km

Step 4: The time taken for the bus journey is:

240/y hours

Step 5: The total time taken for the journey is given as 4 hours. So, we can write:

60/x + 240/y = 4

Step 6: Let's simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by xy:

240x + 60y = 4xy

Step 7: Now, let's consider the second scenario where Ronnie travels 100 km by train and the remaining by bus. So, the time taken for the train journey is:

100/x hours

Step 8: The distance covered by the bus is:

300 - 100 = 200 km

Step 9: The time taken for the bus journey is:

200/y hours

Step 10: The total time taken for the journey is given as 10 minutes (or 1/6 hours) longer than the previous scenario. So, we can write:

100/x + 200/y = 4 + 1/6

Step 11: Let's simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 6xy:

600x + 120y = 24xy + 2xy

Step 12: Now, we have two equations:

240x + 60y = 4xy

600x + 120y = 26xy

Step 13: We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y. Let's start by multiplying the first equation by 5:

1200x + 300y = 20xy

Step 14: Now, let's subtract the second equation from this equation:

-600x - 180y = -6xy

Step 15: Simplifying this equation, we get:

600x + 180y = 6xy

Step 16: Adding this equation to the second equation, we get:

1200x + 300y + 600x + 120y = 26xy + 6xy

If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the distance of the journey is ""d"" km and the speed of the train is ""s"" km/hr.

According to the problem, if the train were 6 km/hr faster, it would have taken 8 hours less than the scheduled time. This means:

d / (s+6) = (d/s) - 8

Simplifying this equation, we get:

ds - 8s(d+6) = d(d+6)

ds - 8ds - 48s = d^2 + 6d

Rearranging and simplifying, we get:

d^2 - (s+56)d - 48s = 0

Similarly, if the train were slower by 6 km/hr, it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. This means:

d / (s-6) = (d/s) + 12

Simplifying this equation, we get:

ds + 12s(d-6) = d(d-6)

ds + 12ds - 72s = d^2 - 6d

Rearranging and simplifying, we get:

d^2 - (s-72)d - 72s = 0

Now we have two equations with two variables (d and s). We can solve them simultaneously to find the values of d and s.

Multiplying the first equation by 12 and the second equation by 8, we get:

12d^2 - 12(s+56)d - 576s = 0

8d^2 - 8(s-72)d - 576s = 0

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

4d^2 - 4(2s+128)d = 0

Simplifying, we get:

d^2 - 2s - 64 = 0

Now we can substitute this value of d^2 in any of the previous equations to find the value of s. Let's use the first equation:

d^2 - (s+56)d - 48s = 0

Substituting d^2 = 2s+64, we get:

2s+64 - (s+56)(2s+64)/(2s+64) - 48s/(2s+64) = 0

Simplifying, we get:

s^2 Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",":

s^2 - 2s - 256 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

s = 18 or s = -14

Since the speed of the train cannot be negative, we take s = 18 km/hr.

Now we can use any of the previous equations to find the value of d. Let's use the first equation:

d / (s+6) = (d/s) - 8

Substituting s = 18, we get:

d / 24 = d/18 - 8

Simplifying, we get:

d = 432 km

Therefore, the length of the journey is 432 km.",False,False

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Assign variables
Let's use ""b"" to represent the cost of one bat and ""c"" to represent the cost of one ball.

Step 2: Write equations
From the problem, we can write two equations:
7b + 6c = 3800
3b + 5c = 1750

Step 3: Solve the system of equations
We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:
- Multiply the second equation by 2 to get 6b + 10c = 3500
- Subtract the first equation from the second to get 2b + 4c = -300
- Multiply the first equation by 2 to get 14b + 12c = 7600
- Subtract 3 times the second equation from the first to get 8b = 2200
- Solve for b: b = 275

Step 4: Find c
Now that we know b, we can substitute it into one of the equations to find c:
7(275) + 6c = 3800
6c = 1855
c = 309.17

From the first condition, we know that: 

x + y = 9 

From the second condition, we know that: 

9(10x + y) = 2(10y + x) 

Expanding and simplifying: 

90x + 9y = 20y + 2x 

88x = 11y 

8x = y 

Substituting this into the first equation: 

x + 8x = 9 

9x = 9 

x = 1 

So the tens digit is 1 and the units digit is 8. 

Therefore, the number is 18.

He received an annual interest of $130. But, if he had interchanged and invested he would have received $4 more. How much amount did he invest at the two rates?

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the amount invested at 12% is x and the amount invested at 10% is y. 

According to the problem, the person received an annual interest of $130. So, we can write: 

0.12x + 0.1y = 130 

Now, let's consider the second scenario where the person interchanged the amounts invested. This means that he would have invested x at 10% and y at 12%. 

The interest he would have received in this case can be calculated as: 

0.1x + 0.12y = 130 + 4 

(We add 4 to the interest because the problem states that he would have received $4 more if he had interchanged the amounts) 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

0.1x + 0.12y = 134 

Now, we have two equations with two variables: 

0.12x + 0.1y = 130 

0.1x + 0.12y = 134 

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y. 

Multiplying the first equation by 0.12 and the second equation by 0.1, we get: 

0.0144x + 0.012y = 15.6 

0.01x + 0.012y = 13.4 

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: 

0.0044x = 2.2 

x = 500 

Substituting this value of x in the first equation, we get: 

0.12(500) + 0.1y = 130 

60 + 0.1y = 130 

0.1y = 70 

y = 700 

Therefore, the person invested $500 at 12% and $700 at 10%. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",$500 at 12% and $700 at 10%.,False,False

Find their present ages?,36.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: At present a father is three times as old as his son. After 12 years his age will be twice the age of his son. Find their present ages?

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the father's current age is ""F"" and the son's current age is ""S"". 

According to the problem, we know that: 

F = 3S   (since the father is three times as old as his son) 

After 12 years, their ages will be: 

F + 12 and S + 12 

And we also know that: 

F + 12 = 2(S + 12)   (since the father's age will be twice the age of his son after 12 years) 

Now we can use the first equation to substitute F: 

3S + 12 = 2(S + 12) 

Solving for S: 

3S + 12 = 2S + 24 

S = 12 

So the son's current age is 12. 

Using the first equation again, we can find the father's current age: 

F = 3S = 3(12) = 36 

Therefore, the father's current age is 36. 

So the present ages of the father and son are 36 and 12, respectively. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",36 and 12.,False,False

x = y + 18

3. Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(y + 18) + y = 180

4. Simplifying the equation:

2y + 18 = 180

2y = 162

y = 81

5. We can now use the second equation to find x:

x = y + 18 = 81 + 18 = 99

So, the two supplementary angles are 81 degrees and 99 degrees. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",81 and 99.,False,False

If we increase the length by 3 units and the breadth by 2 units, the area increases by 67 square units. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.",17.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: The area of a rectangle gets reduced by 9 square units, if its length is reduced by 5 units and breadth is increased by 3 units. If we increase the length by 3 units and the breadth by 2 units, the area increases by 67 square units. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.

A: Let's think step by step. Let the length of the rectangle be L and the breadth be B. 

According to the problem, 

(L-5)(B+3) = LB - 9 

Expanding the left-hand side, we get: 

LB + 3L - 5B - 15 = LB - 9 

Simplifying, we get: 

3L - 5B = -6 

Similarly, 

(L+3)(B+2) = LB + 67 

Expanding the left-hand side, we get: 

LB + 2L + 3B + 6 = LB + 67 

Simplifying, we get: 

2L + 3B = 61 

Now we have two equations: 

3L - 5B = -6 

2L + 3B = 61 

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are 27 units by 10 units. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",27 units by 10 units.,False,False
"In a 2-digit number, the tens digit is 4 times the units digit. When the digits are reversed, the new number formed is 54 less than the original number.

When the digits are reversed, the new number formed is 54 less than the original number. Find the original number.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the tens digit ""t"" and the units digit ""u"". 

From the first sentence, we know that: 

t = 4u 

From the second sentence, we know that when the digits are reversed, the new number formed is 54 less than the original number. This means: 

10u + t = 10t + u - 54 

We can substitute the first equation (t = 4u) into the second equation: 

10u + 4u = 40u 

10t + u = 10u + 4u - 54 

Simplifying: 

14u = 10u - 54 

4u = -54 

u = -13.5 

Uh oh, this doesn't make sense. We can't have a negative units digit. 

So, there must be an error in the problem statement. Perhaps it was meant to say that when the digits are reversed, the new number formed is 45 less than the original number. 

Let's try that: 

10u + t = 10t + u - 45 

Substituting t = 4u: 

10u + 4u = 40u 

10t + u = 10u + 4u - 45 

Simplifying: 

14u = 45 

u = 3.21 

Again, this doesn't make sense. We can't have a non-integer units digit. 

So, unfortunately, we cannot solve this problem as it is currently stated. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",N/A.,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's start by assigning variables to their ages. Let's say Anil's age is A and Ajith's age is B.
2. We know that Anil is 9 years older than Ajith, so we can write an equation: A = B + 9.
3. We also know that in 10 years, Anil will be twice as old as Ajith was 10 years ago. This can be written as: A + 10 = 2(B - 10).
4. Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation: (B + 9) + 10 = 2(B - 10).
5. Simplifying this equation, we get: B + 19 = 2B - 20.
6. Solving for B, we get: B = 39.
7. Using the first equation, we can find A: A = B + 9 = 48.

x = 52

So the certain number we are looking for is 52. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",52,True,False
The second angle of a triangle is double the first. The third angle is 40 less than the first. Find the three angles.,88.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: The second angle of a triangle is double the first. The third angle is 40 less than the first. Find the three angles.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the first angle ""x"". 

According to the problem, the second angle is double the first. So the second angle is 2x. 

The third angle is 40 less than the first, so it is x - 40. 

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. 

So we can set up an equation: 

x + 2x + (x - 40) = 180 

Simplifying: 

4x - 40 = 180 

Adding 40 to both sides: 

4x = 220 

Dividing by 4: 

x = 55 

So the first angle is 55 degrees. 

The second angle is double the first, so it is 2x = 110 degrees. 

The third angle is 40 less than the first, so it is x - 40 = 15 degrees. 

Therefore, the three angles are: 

55 degrees, 110 degrees, and 15 degrees. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","55, 110, 15.",False,False

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the cost of the love seat ""x"". 

According to the problem, the cost of the sofa is double the cost of the love seat, so we can write: 

Cost of sofa = 2x 

Now we know that the total cost of the sofa and love seat together is $444, so we can write: 

Cost of sofa + Cost of love seat = $444 

Substituting the expression we found for the cost of the sofa: 

2x + x = $444 

Simplifying: 

3x = $444 

Dividing both sides by 3: 

x = $148 

So the love seat costs $148. 

To find the cost of the sofa, we can use the expression we found earlier: 

Cost of sofa = 2x = 2($148) = $296 

Therefore, the sofa costs $296. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",the love seat costs $148 and the sofa costs $296.,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the cost of the saddle ""x"". 

According to the problem, the horse cost 4 times as much as the saddle, so we can write: 

Cost of horse = 4x 

We also know that the total cost of the horse and saddle together is 5000 dollars, so we can write: 

Cost of horse + Cost of saddle = 5000 

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation: 

4x + x = 5000 

Simplifying: 

5x = 5000 

Dividing both sides by 5: 

x = 1000 

So the saddle cost 1000 dollars. 

To find the cost of the horse, we can use the first equation: 

Cost of horse = 4x = 4(1000) = 4000 

So the horse cost 4000 dollars. 

Therefore, the saddle cost 1000 dollars and the horse cost 4000 dollars. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",saddle = $1000 and horse = $4000.,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the cost of the helmet ""h"" (in dollars). 

According to the problem, we know that the cost of the bicycle is 5 times the cost of the helmet. So, the cost of the bicycle is 5h. 

We also know that the total cost of the bicycle and helmet together is 240 dollars. So, we can set up an equation: 

h + 5h = 240 

Simplifying this equation: 

6h = 240 

Dividing both sides by 6: 

h = 40 

So, the helmet costs 40 dollars. 

We also know that the bicycle costs 5 times as much as the helmet, so: 

bicycle cost = 5 x helmet cost 

bicycle cost = 5 x 40 

bicycle cost = 200 

Therefore, the bicycle costs 200 dollars. 

To check our answer, we can add the cost of the helmet and the cost of the bicycle: 

40 + 200 = 240 

So, our answer is correct. The helmet costs 40 dollars and the bicycle costs 200 dollars. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","Helmet: $40

According to the problem, the second angle is five times as large as the first. So, the measure of the second angle would be 5x. 

The problem also tells us that the measure of the third angle is 12 degrees greater than that of the first angle. So, the measure of the third angle would be x + 12. 

Now, we know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. So, we can set up an equation:

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the first angle ""x"". 

According to the problem, the second angle is three times the first. So the second angle is 3x. 

The third angle is 12 degrees less than twice the first. So the third angle is 2x - 12. 

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So we can set up an equation:

A: Let's think step by step. Let's start by assigning variables to the dimensions of the rectangle. 

Let's say that the width is ""w"" cm. 

Since the length is 15 cm greater than the width, we can say that the length is ""w + 15"" cm. 

Now we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: 

Perimeter = 2(length + width) 

Substituting in our variables: 

150 = 2(w + 15 + w) 

Simplifying: 

150 = 2(2w + 15) 

75 = 2w + 15 

60 = 2w 

w = 30 

So the width of the rectangle is 30 cm. 

To find the length, we can use the equation we came up with earlier: 

Length = width + 15 

Length = 30 + 15 

Length = 45 

So the dimensions of the rectangle are 30 cm by 45 cm. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",30 cm by 45 cm.,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. Let's start by assigning variables to the dimensions of the basketball court. 

Let's say that the width is ""w"" meters. 

Since the length is 14 meters more than the width, we can say that the length is ""w + 14"" meters. 

Now we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: 

Perimeter = 2(length + width) 

We know that the perimeter is 96 meters, so we can substitute: 

96 = 2(w + w + 14) 

Simplifying: 

96 = 4w + 28 

Subtracting 28 from both sides: 

68 = 4w 

Dividing by 4: 

w = 17 

So the width of the basketball court is 17 meters. 

To find the length, we can use the equation we came up with earlier: 

Length = width + 14 

Length = 17 + 14 

Length = 31 

So the length of the basketball court is 31 meters. 

Therefore, the dimensions of the basketball court are 17 meters by 31 meters. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",17 meters by 31 meters.,False,False

What is the area of the rectangle?,216.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: A square has sides that measure 15 cm. A rectangle has a length of 18 cm. The perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle. What is the area of the rectangle?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the perimeter of the square. 

Perimeter of a square = 4 x side length 

Perimeter of the square = 4 x 15 cm = 60 cm 

Now, we know that the perimeter of the rectangle is also 60 cm. 

Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 x (length + width) 

We know the length is 18 cm, but we don't know the width. Let's use algebra to solve for it. 

60 cm = 2 x (18 cm + width) 

30 cm = 18 cm + width 

Width = 12 cm 

Now we know that the rectangle has a length of 18 cm and a width of 12 cm. 

Area of a rectangle = length x width 

Area of the rectangle = 18 cm x 12 cm = 216 cm² 

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 216 cm². Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",216,True,False

If he works at the same rate, how many minutes will it take Kevin to mow a square lawn that measures 60 meters on each side?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the area of the first lawn:

Area = side x side = 30m x 30m = 900 square meters

Next, let's calculate Kevin's mowing rate:

Rate = Area / Time = 900 square meters / 45 minutes = 20 square meters per minute

Now, let's use this rate to calculate how long it will take Kevin to mow the second lawn:

Area = side x side = 60m x 60m = 3600 square meters

Time = Area / Rate = 3600 square meters / 20 square meters per minute = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take Kevin 180 minutes (or 3 hours) to mow a square lawn that measures 60 meters on each side. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",180,False,False

There are 400 square panes of glass each measuring 2.5 feet on each side. Todd offered to pay 10 cents per square foot. Chloe said she would rather get paid 60 cents a pane. Todd agreed and was happy that he was actually going to save money. How much money will Todd save?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total area of all the windows in Todd's art studio. 

Each pane of glass measures 2.5 feet on each side, so the area of each pane is:

2.5 ft x 2.5 ft = 6.25 square feet

There are 400 panes of glass, so the total area of all the windows is:

400 panes x 6.25 sq ft per pane = 2,500 square feet

Now, let's calculate how much Todd would have paid if he had agreed to pay Chloe 10 cents per square foot:

2,500 sq ft x $0.10 per sq ft = $250

So, Todd would have paid $250 if he had agreed to pay Chloe 10 cents per square foot. 

However, Chloe agreed to be paid 60 cents per pane, so let's calculate how much Todd will actually pay her:

400 panes x $0.60 per pane = $240

Todd will pay Chloe $240, which is $10 less than what he would have paid if he had agreed to pay 10 cents per square foot. Therefore, Todd will save $10 by agreeing to pay Chloe 60 cents per pane. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",$10.00 ,False,False

Grandma decided that the pancakes were way too large for her grandchildren and decided to make pancakes that were only 2 inches in diameter. How many small pancakes will Grandma's recipe make?,200.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Grandma has an old family recipe for blueberry pancakes. She can make 8 pancakes that are each 10 inches in diameter. Grandma decided that the pancakes were way too large for her grandchildren and decided to make pancakes that were only 2 inches in diameter. How many small pancakes will Grandma's recipe make?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of one large pancake:

Area of one large pancake = πr^2, where r is the radius (half of the diameter)

Radius of one large pancake = 10/2 = 5 inches

Area of one large pancake = π(5)^2 = 25π square inches

Next, we need to find the area of one small pancake:

Area of one small pancake = πr^2, where r is the radius (half of the diameter)

Radius of one small pancake = 2/2 = 1 inch

Area of one small pancake = π(1)^2 = π square inches

Now, we can find how many small pancakes can be made from the same amount of batter:

Number of small pancakes = (Total area of large pancakes) / (Area of one small pancake)

Number of small pancakes = (8 x 25π) / π

Number of small pancakes = 200

Therefore, Grandma's recipe will make 200 small pancakes. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",200,False,False
Ben draws a circle inside a square piece of paper whose area is 400 square inches. He makes sure than the circle touches each side of the square. What is the area of the circle?,314.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Ben draws a circle inside a square piece of paper whose area is 400 square inches. He makes sure than the circle touches each side of the square. What is the area of the circle?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that the area of the square is 400 square inches. Therefore, we can find the length of each side of the square by taking the square root of 400: 

√400 = 20 

So, the length of each side of the square is 20 inches. 

2. We also know that the circle touches each side of the square. This means that the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of each side of the square: 

diameter = 20 inches 

3. We can use the formula for the area of a circle to find the area of the circle: 

area = πr^2 

But we don't know the radius of the circle. However, we know that the diameter is 20 inches, so we can find the radius by dividing the diameter by 2: 

radius = 20/2 = 10 inches 

4. Now we can substitute the radius into the formula for the area of a circle: 

area = π(10)^2 

area = 100π 

So, the area of the circle is 100π square inches. 

Therefore, the area of the circle is approximately 314.16 square inches (if we use 3.14 as an approximation for π). Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",314.16 square inches.,False,False

Each of the smaller pieces are bent into squares. Each square has a side that measures 2 centimeters. The total area of the smaller squares is 92 square centimeters. What was the original length of wire?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many squares were made from the wire. Let's call this number ""n"". 

Each square has a side of 2 centimeters, so its area is 2 x 2 = 4 square centimeters. 

The total area of all the squares is 92 square centimeters, so we can set up an equation: 

n x 4 = 92 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

n = 23 

So, 23 squares were made from the wire. 

Now, we need to find the original length of the wire. Each square used 4 pieces of wire (since it has 4 sides), so the total length of wire used is: 

23 x 4 x 2 = 184 centimeters 

Therefore, the original length of the wire was 184 centimeters. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",184,True,False

Therefore, Vanessa would have $59 left if she bought as many toys as she could. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",$59.00 ,False,False
"Robin wanted to drink exactly nine bottles of water each day, so she bought six hundred seventeen bottles when they were on sale. How many more bottles will she need to buy on the last day?",4.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Robin wanted to drink exactly nine bottles of water each day, so she bought six hundred seventeen bottles when they were on sale. How many more bottles will she need to buy on the last day?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many bottles Robin needs for a certain number of days. 

If she wants to drink 9 bottles of water each day, and she wants to do this for x number of days, then she will need:

9x bottles of water

Next, we need to figure out how many days she can use the 617 bottles of water she bought on sale. 

If she has 617 bottles of water, and she wants to drink 9 bottles each day, then she can use those bottles for:

617/9 = 68.56 days (rounded to the nearest hundredth)

Since she can't drink a fraction of a bottle, we'll round down to 68 days. 

Now we need to figure out how many more bottles she needs to buy on the last day. 

If she wants to drink 9 bottles of water each day for 68 days, then she will need:

9 x 68 = 612 bottles of water

She already has 617 bottles, so she only needs:

612 - 617 = -5 bottles of water

Wait a minute... negative bottles of water? That doesn't make sense. 

So we made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work. 

Ah, I see the problem. We rounded down to 68 days, but we forgot to account for the last day. 

If she drinks 9 bottles of water each day for 68 days, then she will have used:

9 x 68 = 612 bottles of water

But on the last day, she will still need to drink 9 bottles of water. So she will need:

612 + 9 = 621 bottles of water

She already has 617 bottles, so she needs:

621 - 617 = 4 more bottles of water

Therefore, Robin will need to buy 4 more bottles of water on the last day to reach her goal of drinking 9 bottles of water each day for 68 days. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4,False,False

"At a farm the ratio of cows to horses was 7:2. If there were 21 cows at the farm, how many horses were there?",6.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: At a farm the ratio of cows to horses was 7:2. If there were 21 cows at the farm, how many horses were there?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Write down the given information. 

Ratio of cows to horses = 7:2 

Number of cows = 21 

Step 2: Use the ratio to find the number of horses. 

If the ratio of cows to horses is 7:2, that means for every 7 cows, there are 2 horses.

"Kaleb was playing 'Connect Four' with a friend. The ratio of games he won to games he lost was 3:2, if he won 18 games, how many games did they play total?",30.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Kaleb was playing 'Connect Four' with a friend. The ratio of games he won to games he lost was 3:2, if he won 18 games, how many games did they play total?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Write down the ratio of games Kaleb won to games he lost.

The ratio is 3:2, which means for every 3 games Kaleb wins, he loses 2 games.

Step 2: Use the ratio to find out how many games Kaleb lost.

If Kaleb won 3 games for every 2 games he lost, we can set up a proportion:

3/2 = 18/x

where x is the total number of games played.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3x = 36

x = 12

So Kaleb played a total of 12 games.

Step 3: Check the answer.

If Kaleb won 3 games for every 2 games he lost, and he won 18 games, we can use the ratio to find out how many games he lost:

3/2 = 18/x

3x = 36

x = 12

So Kaleb won 3/5 of the 12 games he played, which is 7.2 games. This doesn't make sense, since he can't win a fraction of a game. Therefore, we need to adjust the ratio to make it a whole number.

We can multiply both sides of the ratio by 2 to get:

6:4

This means for every 6 games Kaleb wins, he loses 4 games. If he won 18 games, we can set up a proportion:

6/4 = 18/x

6x = 72

x = 12

So Kaleb played a total of 12 games, and he won 6/10 of them, which is 6 games. This makes sense, since he can't win a fraction of a game. Therefore, the answer is correct. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",12,False,False

Edeena is packing equal numbers of apple slices and grapes for snacks. Edeena bags the apple slices in groups of 18 and the grapes in groups of 9. What is the smallest number of grapes that she can pack? ,18.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Edeena is packing equal numbers of apple slices and grapes for snacks. Edeena bags the apple slices in groups of 18 and the grapes in groups of 9. What is the smallest number of grapes that she can pack? 

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find a common multiple of 18 and 9, since Edeena wants to pack equal numbers of apple slices and grapes. The smallest common multiple of 18 and 9 is 18, since 9 is a factor of 18.

So, Edeena can pack 18 apple slices and 18 grapes. But we want to know the smallest number of grapes she can pack, so we need to keep looking for a smaller multiple of 9.

The next multiple of 9 after 18 is 27. Edeena can pack 18 apple slices and 27 grapes, since 27 is also a multiple of 18. But we can still do better.

The next multiple of 9 after 27 is 36. Edeena can pack 18 apple slices and 36 grapes, since 36 is also a multiple of 18. And this is the smallest number of grapes she can pack, since there are no smaller multiples of 9 that are also multiples of 18.

Therefore, the smallest number of grapes that Edeena can pack is 36. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",36,False,False

In contrast, Ryan's trucks will only carry loads of 11 packages. If both businesses ended up shipping the same number of packages this morning, what is the minimum number of packages each must have shipped? 

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the common multiple of 18 and 11, which is 198. 

This means that Sarah's Shipping must have shipped at least 198/18 = 11 packages. 

Similarly, Ryan's Mail Services must have shipped at least 198/11 = 18 packages. 

However, we need to find the minimum number of packages each must have shipped. 

So, we can take the LCM (198) and divide it by the maximum capacity of each truck (18 for Sarah's and 11 for Ryan's) to get the minimum number of trucks needed for each company. 

For Sarah's Shipping, we need at least 198/18 = 11 trucks. 

For Ryan's Mail Services, we need at least 198/11 = 18 trucks. 

Since we want to find the minimum number of packages each must have shipped, we can multiply the number of trucks by the capacity of each truck. 

For Sarah's Shipping, the minimum number of packages shipped is 11 trucks x 18 packages per truck = 198 packages. 

For Ryan's Mail Services, the minimum number of packages shipped is 18 trucks x 11 packages per truck = 198 packages.

At the end of the day, Tayli realizes that she gave out the same number of red and blue flyers. What is the minimum number of flyers of each color she distributed? 

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the common multiple of 13 and 20, which is 260. This means that Tayli gave out a total of 260 flyers.

Next, let's find out how many sets of 13 red flyers she gave out. We can do this by dividing 260 by 13, which gives us 20 sets.

Similarly, let's find out how many sets of 20 blue flyers she gave out. We can do this by dividing 260 by 20, which gives us 13 sets.

Now we know that Tayli gave out 20 sets of red flyers and 13 sets of blue flyers. To find the minimum number of flyers of each color, we need to find the smallest multiple of 13 and 20 that is also a multiple of both numbers. This is called the least common multiple (LCM).

The LCM of 13 and 20 is 260, which is the total number of flyers Tayli gave out. This means that she gave out 20 x 13 = 260 red flyers and 13 x 20 = 260 blue flyers.

She wants all the pages to be set up in the same way, with the same combination of photos and newspaper clippings on every page. She also wants to make sure that no items are left over. What is the greatest number of scrapbook pages that Aylin can create?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 18 and 20 to determine the maximum number of pages that can have the same combination of photos and newspaper clippings. 

The prime factorization of 18 is 2 x 3 x 3, and the prime factorization of 20 is 2 x 2 x 5. 

To find the GCF, we need to identify the common factors and multiply them together. The only common factor is 2, so the GCF is 2. 

This means that Aylin can create pairs of pages with the same combination of 2 photos and 2 newspaper clippings. 

To determine the maximum number of pages, we need to divide the total number of items (18 photos + 20 newspaper clippings = 38) by the number of items per page (2 photos + 2 newspaper clippings = 4). 

38 ÷ 4 = 9 with a remainder of 2. 

This means that Aylin can create 9 pairs of pages with the same combination of items, and she will have 2 items left over. 

To use up the remaining items, she can create one more page with 1 photo and 1 newspaper clipping. 

Therefore, the greatest number of scrapbook pages that Aylin can create is 10. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10,False,False

The chocolate cake is cut into 15 pieces and the cheesecake is cut into 6 pieces. If he wants to prepare identical platters without having any cake left over, what is the greatest number of platters he can prepare?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the common factor of 15 and 6, which is 3. 

Then, we can divide the chocolate cake into 3 equal portions, each portion containing 5 pieces. 

Similarly, we can divide the cheesecake into 3 equal portions, each portion containing 2 pieces. 

Now, we have 3 portions of chocolate cake and 3 portions of cheesecake, each portion containing a total of 7 pieces (5 from chocolate cake and 2 from cheesecake). 

To prepare identical platters, we need to put one portion of chocolate cake and one portion of cheesecake on each platter.

"Two bikers are riding a circular path. The first rider completes a round in 12 minutes. The second rider completes a round in 18 minutes. If they both started at the same place and time and go in the same direction, after how many minutes will they meet again at the starting point?",36.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Two bikers are riding a circular path. The first rider completes a round in 12 minutes. The second rider completes a round in 18 minutes. If they both started at the same place and time and go in the same direction, after how many minutes will they meet again at the starting point?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for the second rider to catch up with the first rider. 

To do this, we can use the concept of relative speed. The second rider is faster than the first rider, so he will catch up with the first rider at a certain point on the circular path. 

The relative speed between the two riders is the difference between their speeds, which is:

18 minutes/round - 12 minutes/round = 6 minutes/round

This means that the second rider catches up with the first rider at a rate of 6 minutes per round. 

Now, we need to find the distance between the two riders when the second rider catches up with the first rider. 

Since they are both riding on a circular path, we can think of the distance between them as the difference between the fractions of the circle they have completed. 

Let's say that the first rider has completed x rounds when the second rider catches up with him. Then, the second rider has completed x + 1 rounds. 

The fraction of the circle completed by the first rider is x/1 (since he has completed one full round). The fraction of the circle completed by the second rider is (x + 1)/1. 

The difference between these fractions is:

(x + 1)/1 - x/1 = 1/1

So, when the second rider catches up with the first rider, they are one full circle apart. 

Now, we can use this information to find the time it takes for them to meet again at the starting point. 

Since they are one full circle apart when the second rider catches up with the first rider, they will meet again at the starting point after one full round. 

The time it takes for them to complete one full round is the least common multiple of 12 and 18, which is 36. 

Therefore, they will meet again at the starting point after 36 minutes. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",36,False,False
Sean has 8-inch pieces of toy train track and Ruth has 18-inch pieces of train track.

How many of each piece would each child need to build tracks that are equal in length?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We need to find the common length that both Sean and Ruth can use to build their tracks. This common length should be a multiple of both 8 and 18. 

2. The smallest multiple of both 8 and 18 is 72. Therefore, both Sean and Ruth can use 72-inch pieces of train track to build their tracks. 

3. To find how many 8-inch pieces Sean needs to make a 72-inch track, we divide 72 by 8: 

   72 ÷ 8 = 9 

   Sean needs 9 pieces of 8-inch train track to make a 72-inch track. 

4. To find how many 18-inch pieces Ruth needs to make a 72-inch track, we divide 72 by 18: 

   72 ÷ 18 = 4 

   Ruth needs 4 pieces of 18-inch train track to make a 72-inch track. 

Therefore, Sean needs 9 pieces of 8-inch train track and Ruth needs 4 pieces of 18-inch train track to build tracks that are equal in length. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9 pieces of 8-inch train track and 4 pieces of 18-inch train track.,False,False

Every 30th caller received free concert tickets. How many callers must get through before one of them receives both a coupon and a concert ticket?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 100 and 30, which is 300. This means that every 300th caller will receive both the $100 bill and the concert tickets.

Next, we need to find the first time that a caller will be both the 100th and 30th caller. We can do this by finding the LCM of 100 and 30 again, but this time starting from the 30th caller. The LCM of 100 and 30 starting from 30 is 300 as well.

Therefore, the first caller to receive both the $100 bill and the concert tickets will be the 300th caller overall, or the 270th caller after the first free concert ticket is given away (since the first 29 callers will only receive concert tickets). Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",300,True,False

The common factors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30. 

The greatest common factor is 30. 

This means that each student can receive 30 crayons and 30 pieces of paper. 

To find the largest number of students, we divide the total number of crayons and paper by 30: 

120 + 30 = 150 

150 ÷ 30 = 5 

Therefore, Mrs. Evans can have a maximum of 5 students in her class so that each student gets an equal number of crayons and paper. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 3, which is 33. 

This means that Camryn will practice the trumpet every 33 days and the flute every 33 days. 

Since Camryn practiced both instruments today, we need to find the next time that both 33-day cycles will align. 

To do this, we can find the next multiple of 33 after today's date. Let's say today is Day 1. 

The next multiple of 33 after Day 1 is Day 33. On Day 33, Camryn will practice the trumpet and the flute again in the same day. 

Therefore, the answer is 33 days until Camryn practices the trumpet and flute again in the same day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",33,False,False

If Sherman and Brad both went golfing today, how many days until they will go golfing on the same day again?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that Sherman goes golfing every 6th day, so we can write down a sequence of days when he goes golfing: Day 1, Day 7, Day 13, Day 19, Day 25, Day 31, and so on.

2. Similarly, we know that Brad goes golfing every 7th day, so we can write down a sequence of days when he goes golfing: Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29, and so on.

3. We want to find the next day when both Sherman and Brad will go golfing on the same day. To do this, we need to find the next number in both sequences that is the same.

4. We can start by looking at the first few numbers in each sequence: Day 1 for both, Day 7 for Sherman, and Day 8 for Brad. These are not the same, so we need to keep looking.

5. The next number in Sherman's sequence is Day 13, and the next number in Brad's sequence is Day 15. These are still not the same.

6. We can keep going until we find the next number that is the same in both sequences. We eventually find that both Sherman and Brad will go golfing on Day 42.

7. Therefore, the number of days until they will go golfing on the same day again is 42 - 1 (since they both went golfing today) = 41 days. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",41,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that Enzo wins 5 tickets from every game and Beatriz wins 11 tickets from every game.
2. Let's call the number of games that Enzo played ""x"". This means that Enzo won 5x tickets.
3. Let's call the number of games that Beatriz played ""y"". This means that Beatriz won 11y tickets.
4. We also know that Enzo and Beatriz won the same number of total tickets. This means that 5x = 11y.
5. To find the minimum number of games that Enzo could have played, we need to find the smallest values of x and y that satisfy the equation 5x = 11y.
6. One way to do this is to start with the smallest possible value of x (which is 1) and see if there is a corresponding value of y that satisfies the equation.
7. If we plug in x = 1, we get 5(1) = 11y, which simplifies to 5 = 11y. This equation has no integer solutions, so we need to try a larger value of x.
8. If we plug in x = 2, we get 5(2) = 11y, which simplifies to 10 = 11y. This equation also has no integer solutions, so we need to try a larger value of x again.
9. If we plug in x = 3, we get 5(3) = 11y, which simplifies to 15 = 11y. This equation has an integer solution, y = 15/11. However, we are looking for integer solutions, so we need to try a larger value of x again.
10. If we plug in x = 4, we get 5(4) = 11y, which simplifies to 20 = 11y. This equation also has no integer solutions, so we need to try a larger value of x again.

39 pairs of headphones = 78 individual headphones
13 music players

Total = 78 + 13 = 91 items

Next, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 78 and 13. The GCF is the largest number that divides both 78 and 13 evenly. In this case, the GCF is 13.

To make identical packages, we need to divide the total number of items by the GCF:

91 ÷ 13 = 7

Therefore, Tim can make 7 identical packages, each containing 13 headphones and 1 music player. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",7,False,False
Yadira's mom is buying hot dogs and hot dog buns for the family barbecue. Hot dogs come in packs of 12 and hot dog buns come in packs of 9. The store does not sell parts of a pack and Yadira's mom wants the same number of hot dogs as hot dog buns. What is the smallest total number of hot dogs that Yadira's mom can purchase?,36.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Yadira's mom is buying hot dogs and hot dog buns for the family barbecue. Hot dogs come in packs of 12 and hot dog buns come in packs of 9. The store does not sell parts of a pack and Yadira's mom wants the same number of hot dogs as hot dog buns. What is the smallest total number of hot dogs that Yadira's mom can purchase?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find a common multiple of 12 and 9, since we want the same number of hot dogs and hot dog buns. 

The multiples of 12 are: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, 168, 180, 192, 204, 216, 228, 240, 252, 264, 276, 288, 300... 

The multiples of 9 are: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99, 108, 117, 126, 135, 144, 153, 162, 171, 180, 189, 198, 207, 216, 225, 234, 243, 252, 261, 270... 

We can see that the smallest common multiple of 12 and 9 is 36. 

So, Yadira's mom can buy 3 packs of hot dogs (3 x 12 = 36) and 4 packs of hot dog buns (4 x 9 = 36) to have the same number of hot dogs and hot dog buns. 

Therefore, the smallest total number of hot dogs that Yadira's mom can purchase is 36. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",36,False,False
"Miranda and Savannah are excited that a new store just opened in town! They go together the first day it opens! Each time Miranda goes to the store she plans to spend $7, and each time Savannah goes to the store she plans to spend $9. A few weeks from now, Miranda and Savannah are surprised to find out that they have spent the exact same total amount of money at the store. What is the least possible number of times that Miranda has been to the store?",9.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Miranda and Savannah are excited that a new store just opened in town!

A few weeks from now, Miranda and Savannah are surprised to find out that they have spent the exact same total amount of money at the store. What is the least possible number of times that Miranda has been to the store?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's call the number of times Miranda has been to the store ""m"" and the number of times Savannah has been to the store ""s"".
2. We know that Miranda spends $7 each time she goes to the store, so the total amount of money she has spent is 7m.
3. Similarly, Savannah spends $9 each time she goes to the store, so the total amount of money she has spent is 9s.
4. We also know that Miranda and Savannah have spent the same total amount of money at the store, so we can set up an equation: 7m = 9s.
5. To find the least possible number of times that Miranda has been to the store, we need to find the smallest values of m and s that satisfy the equation 7m = 9s.
6. One way to do this is to start with small values of m and see if there is a corresponding value of s that satisfies the equation. If not, we can increase m and try again.
7. Let's start with m = 1. If Miranda has been to the store once, she has spent $7. To make the total amount of money spent by Savannah equal to $7, we need s = 7/9, which is not a whole number. So m = 1 does not work.
8. Let's try m = 2. If Miranda has been to the store twice, she has spent $14. To make the total amount of money spent by Savannah equal to $14, we need s = 14/9, which is not a whole number. So m = 2 does not work either.
9. Let's try m = 3. If Miranda has been to the store three times, she has spent $21. To make the total amount of money spent by Savannah equal to $21, we need s = 21/9 = 7/3, which is not a whole number. So m = 3 does not work either.
10. Let's try m = 4. If Miranda has been to the store four times, she has spent $28. To make the total amount of money spent by Savannah equal to $28, we need s = 28/9, which is not a whole number. So m = 4 does not work either.
11. Let's try m = 5. If Miranda has been to the store Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5,False,False

Abe would like to plant the trees in rows that all have the same number of trees and are made up of only one type of tree. What is the greatest number of trees Abe can have in each row?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 54 and 27 to determine the maximum number of trees that can be in each row. 

The prime factorization of 54 is 2 x 3 x 3 x 3, and the prime factorization of 27 is 3 x 3 x 3. 

To find the GCF, we need to identify the common factors and choose the greatest one. In this case, the only common factor is 3 x 3 x 3, which is equal to 27. 

Therefore, the greatest number of trees Abe can have in each row is 27. He can plant 2 rows of 27 oak trees and 1 row of 27 pine trees. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",27,False,False
"Your local radio station is having their yearly music player and concert ticket giveaway. For one minute, every 5th caller will win a music player and every 7th caller will win concert tickets.

What number caller were you?",35.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Your local radio station is having their yearly music player and concert ticket giveaway. For one minute, every 5th caller will win a music player and every 7th caller will win concert tickets. You were just the first caller to win both a music player and concert tickets! What number caller were you?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that we were the first caller to win both a music player and concert tickets. This means that we were both the 5th and 7th caller.

Next, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 7. The LCM of 5 and 7 is 35.

This means that every 35th caller will win both a music player and concert tickets. Since we were the first caller to win both, we must have been the 35th caller minus some number of callers.

To find out how many callers we were before the 35th caller, we can use the fact that we were the 5th and 7th caller. This means that we were a multiple of both 5 and 7.

The smallest multiple of both 5 and 7 is 35, so we can subtract 35 from our position until we get a number that is a multiple of both 5 and 7.

35 - 5 = 30 (not a multiple of 7)
35 - 10 = 25 (not a multiple of 7)
35 - 15 = 20 (a multiple of both 5 and 7)

So we were the 20th caller. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",20,False,False

The first piece is 44 inches wide and the second piece is 33 inches wide. Jazmin wants to cut the paper into strips that are equal in width and are as wide as possible. How wide should Jazmin cut each strip?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 44 and 33. 

The factors of 44 are: 1, 2, 4, 11, 22, 44. 

The factors of 33 are: 1, 3, 11, 33. 

The common factors are: 1 and 11. 

Therefore, the GCF of 44 and 33 is 11. 

Next, we need to divide each paper width by the GCF: 

44 ÷ 11 = 4 

33 ÷ 11 = 3 

This means that Jazmin can cut each paper into 4 strips of equal width for the first piece and 3 strips for the second piece. 

Finally, we need to find the width of each strip: 

For the first piece: 

44 inches ÷ 4 strips = 11 inches per strip 

For the second piece: 

33 inches ÷ 3 strips = 11 inches per strip 

Therefore, Jazmin should cut each strip to be 11 inches wide. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",11 inches.,False,False

If Zayed creates the greatest number of identical packages possible, how many pencils will be in each package?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 72 and 24. 

The factors of 72 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72. 

The factors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. 

The common factors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12. 

The greatest common factor is 12. 

This means that Zayed can make 12 identical packages. 

To find out how many pencils will be in each package, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of packages: 

72 pencils ÷ 12 packages = 6 pencils per package. 

Therefore, each package will have 6 pencils. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 86 and 42 to determine how many cookies can be in each package. 

The prime factorization of 86 is 2 x 43. 

The prime factorization of 42 is 2 x 3 x 7. 

The GCF of 86 and 42 is 2. 

So, Shaquira can make packages of 2 cookies each. 

To find the number of packages, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each package: 

86 + 42 = 128 total cookies 

128 ÷ 2 = 64 packages 

Therefore, Shaquira can make 64 identical packages of cookies to sell. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",64,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 32 and 80 to determine the maximum number of teams that can be created with an equal number of forwards and guards. 

The prime factorization of 32 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2, and the prime factorization of 80 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 5. 

To find the GCF, we need to identify the common factors and multiply them together. The common factors are 2 x 2 x 2 x 2, which equals 16. 

So, there can be a maximum of 16 teams with an equal number of forwards and guards. 

Next, we need to divide the total number of guards (80) by the number of teams (16) to find out how many guards will be on each team. 

80 ÷ 16 = 5 

Therefore, each team will have 5 guards. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5,False,False

All yellow paint comes in 2-liter containers while blue paint is sold in containers of 19 liter. What is the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's call the amount of yellow paint sold ""y"" (in liters).
2. Since the store sold equal quantities of yellow and blue paint, we know that the amount of blue paint sold must also be ""y"" liters.
3. We also know that yellow paint comes in 2-liter containers, so the amount of yellow paint sold must be a multiple of 2.
4. On the other hand, blue paint comes in 19-liter containers, so the amount of blue paint sold must be a multiple of 19.
5. To find the smallest amount of each paint color sold, we need to find the smallest common multiple of 2 and 19.
6. The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 19 are 19.

If Kristen wanted to have the same number of gift bags as bows, what is the smallest number of gift bags she would have to buy?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Kristen needs to have the same number of gift bags as bows.
2. The smallest number of bows she can buy is 5.
3. Therefore, she needs to buy at least 5 gift bags to match the number of bows.
4. However, 5 gift bags is not enough because it is not divisible by 12 (the number of gift bags in a pack).
5. The next multiple of 12 after 5 is 12 itself.
6. Therefore, Kristen needs to buy at least 12 gift bags to match the number of bows.
7. This way, she can buy 2 packs of gift bags (12 in each pack) and 3 packs of bows (5 in each pack) to have the same number of each. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",12,False,False
"While performing a piece of music, Jacob strikes the cymbals every 7 beats and the triangle is every 2 beats. If he just struck both at the same time, how many beats will pass before he again strikes them at the same time?",14.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: While performing a piece of music, Jacob strikes the cymbals every 7 beats and the triangle is every 2 beats. If he just struck both at the same time, how many beats will pass before he again strikes them at the same time?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 2, which is 14. 

This means that Jacob will strike the cymbals every 14 beats and the triangle every 14/2 = 7 beats. 

If he strikes them both at the same time, he will need to wait until the next time both instruments are struck at the same time. 

The next time the cymbals will be struck is at 14 beats, and the next time the triangle will be struck is at 7 beats. 

Therefore, the next time both instruments will be struck at the same time is at the LCM of 14 and 7, which is 14. 

So Jacob will need to wait 14 beats before he strikes both instruments at the same time again. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",14,False,False
"Jason and Lexi are shelving books at a public library. Jason shelves 6 books at a time, whereas Lexi shelves 17 at a time. If they end up shelving the same number of books, what is the smallest number of books each could have shelved?",102.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Jason and Lexi are shelving books at a public library. Jason shelves 6 books at a time, whereas Lexi shelves 17 at a time. If they end up shelving the same number of books, what is the smallest number of books each could have shelved?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find a common multiple of 6 and 17, which is the smallest number that both 6 and 17 can divide into evenly. The least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 17 is 102.

Next, we need to find how many times each person can shelve their respective number of books to reach a total of 102 books. For Jason, we can divide 102 by 6 to get 17, meaning he can shelve 6 books 17 times to reach 102. For Lexi, we can divide 102 by 17 to get 6, meaning she can shelve 17 books 6 times to reach 102.

Therefore, the smallest number of books each could have shelved is 6, which is the number of times Lexi shelved her books, and the number of times Jason shelved his books. Lexi would have shelved a total of 6 x 17 = 102 books, and Jason would have shelved a total of 6 x 6 = 36 books. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6,False,False

What is the greatest number of groups that can be formed?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 10 and 15, which is 5. 

Next, we can divide the boys and girls into groups of 5. 

There are 2 groups of 5 boys, and 3 groups of 5 girls. 

Therefore, the greatest number of groups that can be formed is 2 (since we can't form more groups of boys than there are). 

Each group will have 5 boys and 5 girls. 

So, we can form 2 groups with 5 boys and 5 girls in each group. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2,False,False
"Ezra is buying nuts and bolts at a local hardware store. The store sells nuts in packs of 13 and bolts in packs of 8. If Ezra wishes to buy the same number of nuts and bolts, what is the smallest number of nuts that he can buy?",104.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Ezra is buying nuts and bolts at a local hardware store. The store sells nuts in packs of 13 and bolts in packs of 8. If Ezra wishes to buy the same number of nuts and bolts, what is the smallest number of nuts that he can buy?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We need to find the smallest number of nuts that Ezra can buy.
2. Let's assume that he buys x packs of nuts and y packs of bolts.
3. Each pack of nuts contains 13 nuts, so he will have 13x nuts in total.
4. Each pack of bolts contains 8 bolts, so he will have 8y bolts in total.
5. We know that he wants to buy the same number of nuts and bolts, so 13x = 8y.
6. To find the smallest number of nuts, we need to find the smallest values of x and y that satisfy this equation.
7. We can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common factor of 13 and 8, which is 1. This gives us 13x/1 = 8y/1, or 13x = 8y.
8. The smallest values of x and y that satisfy this equation are x = 8 and y = 13.
9. Therefore, Ezra needs to buy 8 packs of nuts, which will give him 13 x 8 = 104 nuts in total. He also needs to buy 13 packs of bolts, which will give him 8 x 13 = 104 bolts in total.
10. This way, he will have the same number of nuts and bolts, and he will have bought the smallest number of nuts possible. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8 packs of nuts.,False,False
"The Khan Corporation would like to donate 48 computers and 32 printers to local schools. The corporation would like to make sure that each school receives the same set of computers and printers, with none left over. What is the greatest number of schools that The Khan Corporation can donate to?",16.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: The Khan Corporation would like to donate 48 computers and 32 printers to local schools. The corporation would like to make sure that each school receives the same set of computers and printers, with none left over. What is the greatest number of schools that The Khan Corporation can donate to?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 48 and 32 to determine the largest number of sets of computers and printers we can make. 

The prime factorization of 48 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3, and the prime factorization of 32 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2. 

The GCF is the product of the common prime factors raised to the lowest power they appear in either number. In this case, the common prime factors are 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16. 

So we can make 16 sets of computers and printers. 

Next, we need to divide the total number of computers and printers by the number of sets to find out how many schools can receive a set. 

48 + 32 = 80 total items 

80 ÷ 16 = 5 schools 

Therefore, The Khan Corporation can donate to a maximum of 5 schools, with each school receiving 9 computers and 6 printers. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5,False,False
"Mitch owns a business and assigns two of his employees their shifts. He assigns the first employee shifts in blocks of 2 hours, and he assigns the second worker shifts in blocks of 11 hours. If both workers must receive the same number of hours, what is the minimum number of hours each must be assigned?",22.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Mitch owns a business and assigns two of his employees their shifts. He assigns the first employee shifts in blocks of 2 hours, and he assigns the second worker shifts in blocks of 11 hours. If both workers must receive the same number of hours, what is the minimum number of hours each must be assigned?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the common multiple of 2 and 11, which is 22. 

This means that we can divide the 22 hours into blocks of 2 hours for the first employee and blocks of 11 hours for the second employee. 

Therefore, each employee must be assigned a minimum of 22 hours. 

To check, we can see that the first employee would have 11 blocks of 2 hours, which adds up to 22 hours. The second employee would have 2 blocks of 11 hours, which also adds up to 22 hours. 

So, the minimum number of hours each employee must be assigned is 22 hours. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",22,True,False
"A choir teacher is dividing 10 sopranos and 15 altos into singing groups. He wants each group to have the same combination of sopranos and altos, with no singers left over.

He wants each group to have the same combination of sopranos and altos, with no singers left over. What is the greatest number of groups he can make?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 10 and 15, which is 5. 

This means that we can form groups of 5 singers, with an equal number of sopranos and altos in each group. 

To find the number of groups we can make, we need to divide the total number of singers by the number of singers in each group: 

Total number of singers = 10 sopranos + 15 altos = 25 singers 

Number of singers in each group = 5 (since we want an equal number of sopranos and altos in each group) 

Number of groups = Total number of singers / Number of singers in each group 

Number of groups = 25 / 5 = 5 

Therefore, the choir teacher can make 5 groups of 5 singers each, with an equal number of sopranos and altos in each group. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5,True,False

If Martha wishes to purchase the same number of pencils as pens, what is the smallest number of pens that she can buy?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Martha is buying 18 packs of pencils and 14 packs of pens.
2. Let's assume that she buys x packs of pencils and x packs of pens (since she wants to buy the same number of pencils as pens).
3. So, the total number of packs she buys is 18 + 14 = 32.
4. Since she buys x packs of pencils and x packs of pens, the total number of packs she buys is 2x.
5. Therefore, we can write the equation: 2x = 32.

7. So, Martha can buy 16 packs of pens to have the same number of pencils and pens. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",16,False,False
"In a morning walk, two persons start off together. Their steps measure 75 cm, and 90 cm respectively. What is the minimum distance each should walk so that all can cover the same distance in complete steps?",450.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: In a morning walk, two persons start off together. Their steps measure 75 cm, and 90 cm respectively. What is the minimum distance each should walk so that all can cover the same distance in complete steps?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 75 cm and 90 cm. 

The prime factorization of 75 is 3 x 5 x 5, and the prime factorization of 90 is 2 x 3 x 3 x 5. 

To find the LCM, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number: 

- 2 appears in 90 but not in 75, so we take 2^1. 
- 3 appears in both numbers, but we take the higher power of 3, which is 3^2. 
- 5 appears in both numbers, but we take the higher power of 5, which is 5^2. 

Multiplying these together, we get LCM(75, 90) = 2 x 3^2 x 5^2 = 450. 

So the two persons need to walk a distance of 450 cm and 450 cm respectively to cover the same distance in complete steps. 

To find the number of steps each person takes, we divide the distance by their step length: 

- Person 1 takes 450 cm / 75 cm per step = 6 steps. 
- Person 2 takes 450 cm / 90 cm per step = 5 steps. 

Therefore, each person should walk at least 450 cm to cover the same distance in complete steps. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",450 cm.,False,False

After that, the first clock rings after every 90 minutes, and the second after every 60 minutes. After how many minutes will they again ring together?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. The first time they ring together, both clocks have rung once. 
2. After 90 minutes, the first clock will ring again. 
3. After 120 minutes (2 hours), the second clock will ring twice (once at the start and once after 2 hours). 
4. After 180 minutes (3 hours), the first clock will ring twice (once at the start and once after 90 minutes). 
5. After 240 minutes (4 hours), the second clock will ring three times (once at the start, once after 2 hours, and once after 4 hours). 
6. After 270 minutes (4.5 hours), the first clock will ring three times (once at the start, once after 90 minutes, and once after 180 minutes). 
7. After 360 minutes (6 hours), the second clock will ring six times (once at the start, once every 2 hours). 
8. After 540 minutes (9 hours), the first clock will ring six times (once at the start, once every 90 minutes). 

Therefore, they will ring together again after 540 minutes or 9 hours. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",540,False,False

P completes a round in 252 seconds and Q in 198 seconds, both starting at the same point. After what time will they meet again at the starting point?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much distance each person covers in one second. We can do this by taking the reciprocal of the time taken to complete one round.

For P, distance covered in one second = 1/252
For Q, distance covered in one second = 1/198

Next, we need to find out the relative speed between P and Q. Since they are running in the same direction, the relative speed will be the difference between their individual speeds.

Relative speed = (1/198) - (1/252) = 1/2772

This means that P and Q will meet again at the starting point every 2772 seconds.

Therefore, the answer is 2772 seconds. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2772,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are less than 6 dozen eggs in the basket. 

6 dozen is equal to 6 x 12 = 72 eggs. So, we know that there are less than 72 eggs in the basket. 

Next, we know that when the eggs are counted 2, 3, 4, or 5 at a time, there are none left over. 

This means that the number of eggs in the basket must be a multiple of 2, 3, 4, and 5. 

The smallest number that is a multiple of 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 60. 

Therefore, there are 60 eggs in the basket. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",60,False,False

If Bill observed the same total number of sparrows and parrots, what is the smallest number of sparrows that he could have observed?",182.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Bill observed two types of birds in the bushes: sparrows and parrots. While the sparrows were in flocks of 13, the parrots were in flocks of 14. If Bill observed the same total number of sparrows and parrots, what is the smallest number of sparrows that he could have observed?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that Bill observed x flocks of sparrows and y flocks of parrots. 

Next, we know that each flock of sparrows has 13 birds, so the total number of sparrows observed would be 13x. Similarly, the total number of parrots observed would be 14y. 

Since Bill observed the same total number of sparrows and parrots, we can set up an equation: 

13x = 14y 

To find the smallest number of sparrows that Bill could have observed, we need to find the smallest values of x and y that satisfy this equation. 

One way to do this is to list out some possible values of x and y and see which ones work: 

x = 1, y = 13: 13 = 14(1) - not a solution 
x = 2, y = 26: 26 = 14(2) - not a solution 
x = 3, y = 39: 39 = 14(3) - not a solution 
x = 4, y = 52: 52 = 14(4) - not a solution 
x = 5, y = 65: 65 = 14(5) - not a solution 
x = 6, y = 78: 78 = 14(6) - not a solution 
x = 7, y = 91: 91 = 14(7) - not a solution

x = 9, y = 117: 117 = 14(9) - not a solution 
x = 10, y = 130: 130 = 14(10) - not a solution 
x = 11, y = 143: 143 = 14(11) + 1 - a solution! 

So the smallest number of sparrows that Bill could have observed is 13x, where x = 11, which is 143. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",143,False,False
"Morris observed two types of birds traveling: ducks and cranes. While the ducks traveled in flocks of 13, the cranes traveled in flocks of 17.

While the ducks traveled in flocks of 13, the cranes traveled in flocks of 17. If Morris observed the same total number of ducks and cranes, what is the smallest number of ducks that he could have observed?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we can represent the number of ducks as 13x and the number of cranes as 17y, where x and y are positive integers. 

Next, we know that Morris observed the same total number of ducks and cranes. So, we can set up an equation: 

13x = 17y 

To find the smallest number of ducks Morris could have observed, we need to find the smallest values of x and y that satisfy this equation. 

We can start by finding the smallest value of y that makes 17y a multiple of 13. 

17y = 13 * (y * 2 + y * 3) 

So, y * 2 + y * 3 = 5y is a multiple of 13. The smallest value of y that satisfies this is y = 13. 

Substituting y = 13 into the equation 13x = 17y, we get: 

13x = 17 * 13 

x = 17 

Therefore, Morris observed 13 * 17 = 221 ducks. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",221,True,False

Martin is also trying to construct a track for his train but is using track pieces that are 20 inches long. How long will the shortest track be if the track that Melanie builds ends up being the same length as Martin's track?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that Melanie's track is made up of 8-inch pieces, and Martin's track is made up of 20-inch pieces.
2. To find the length of the shortest track, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 20.
3. The prime factorization of 8 is 2 x 2 x 2, and the prime factorization of 20 is 2 x 2 x 5.
4. To find the LCM, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. So the LCM of 8 and 20 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 5 = 40.
5. This means that Melanie needs to connect 5 of her 8-inch pieces to make a track that is 40 inches long, and Martin needs to connect 2 of his 20-inch pieces to make a track that is also 40 inches long.

On Monday 3,000 customers came to the theatre. How many people received both free items?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many customers received a free drink. We can do this by dividing the total number of customers by 75:

3000 ÷ 75 = 40

So 40 customers received a free drink.

Next, we need to find out how many customers received a free bag of popcorn. We can do this by dividing the total number of customers by 30:

3000 ÷ 30 = 100

So 100 customers received a free bag of popcorn.

Now we need to find out how many customers received both free items. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple of 75 and 30, which is 150. This means that every 150th customer will receive both free items.

To find out how many customers received both free items, we can divide the total number of customers by 150:

3000 ÷ 150 = 20

So 20 customers received both a free drink and a free bag of popcorn. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",20,False,False

Henry is riding his bike, and Margo is walking. It takes Henry 7 minutes to make it all the way around, and Margo takes 12 minutes. How much time will pass until they meet at the starting line?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far each person travels in one minute. We know that Henry travels the entire circumference of the circle in 7 minutes, so he travels 1/7 of the circumference in one minute. Margo, on the other hand, travels 1/12 of the circumference in one minute.

Next, we need to figure out when they will meet at the starting line. We know that they will meet at the starting line when they have both traveled the same distance. Let's call this distance ""d"".

So, we can set up an equation:

Henry's distance = Margo's distance

(1/7) * d = (1/12) * d

Now we can solve for d:

(1/7) * d = (1/12) * d

Multiply both sides by 84 (the least common multiple of 7 and 12):

12d = 7d

d = 0

This means that they will meet at the starting line when they both start, since they both have to travel 0 distance to get there.

Therefore, the amount of time that will pass until they meet at the starting line is 0 minutes. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",0,False,False

One sign blinks every 9 seconds. The other sign blinks every 15 seconds. In how many seconds will they blink together again?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 15, which is the smallest number that both 9 and 15 divide into evenly. 

To find the LCM, we can list the multiples of each number until we find a common multiple: 

Multiples of 9: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99, 108, 117, 126, 135, 144, 153, 162, 171, 180... 

Multiples of 15: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180... 

We can see that the first common multiple is 45, so the two signs will blink together again every 45 seconds. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",45,False,False

If tacos and cheeseburgers are both on today's menu, how many days will it be before they are both on the menu again?",24.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: The school cafeteria serves tacos every sixth day and cheeseburgers every eighth day. If tacos and cheeseburgers are both on today's menu, how many days will it be before they are both on the menu again?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 8, which is 24. 

This means that tacos will be served on days 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, etc. 

And cheeseburgers will be served on days 8, 16, 24, 32, etc. 

The next time both tacos and cheeseburgers will be served on the same day is on day 24, which is the LCM. 

Therefore, it will be 24 days before they are both on the menu again. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",24,False,False

"Jenny goes to dance class every 6 days, karate class every 12 days, and to the library every 18 days. On December 1st she went to both classes and the libary. How many days from December 1st will she do both classes and go to the library?",36.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Jenny goes to dance class every 6 days, karate class every 12 days, and to the library every 18 days. On December 1st she went to both classes and the libary. How many days from December 1st will she do both classes and go to the library?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6, 12, and 18. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 x 3. 

The prime factorization of 12 is 2 x 2 x 3. 

The prime factorization of 18 is 2 x 3 x 3. 

To find the LCM, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers. 

So the LCM of 6, 12, and 18 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 = 36. 

This means that Jenny will do both classes and go to the library every 36 days. 

Now we need to find out how many days from December 1st that is. 

We can count by multiples of 36: 

December 1st + 36 days = January 6th 

December 1st + 72 days = February 6th 

December 1st + 108 days = March 19th 

So Jenny will do both classes and go to the library on March 19th, which is 108 days from December 1st. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",108,False,False

There were 20 cookies and 40 slices of pizza to be shared equally. Each student had the same number of whole cookies and the same number of slices of pizza with nothing left over. What is the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices the students can each get?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 20 and 40 to determine the maximum number of equal shares. 

The factors of 20 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20. 
The factors of 40 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40. 

The GCF of 20 and 40 is 20. 

So, we can divide the 20 cookies and 40 slices of pizza into 20 equal shares. 

To find the number of cookies and pizza slices each student can get, we divide 20 cookies by 20 shares and 40 slices of pizza by 20 shares. 

Each student can get 1 cookie and 2 slices of pizza. 

Therefore, the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices the students can each get is 1 cookie and 2 slices of pizza. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1 cookie and 2 slices of pizza.,False,False

If there is no remainder, what is the largest possible number of sweets in each tray?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the common factors of 36 and 44. 

The factors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. 

The factors of 44 are: 1, 2, 4, 11, 22, 44. 

The common factors are: 1, 2, 4. 

Next, we need to find the largest possible number of sweets in each tray. 

If we choose orange-flavoured sweets, we can divide 36 by 4 (the largest common factor) to get 9. So, we can have 9 trays of 4 orange-flavoured sweets each. 

If we choose grape-flavoured sweets, we can divide 44 by 4 to get 11. So, we can have 11 trays of 4 grape-flavoured sweets each. 

Therefore, the largest possible number of sweets in each tray is 4. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4,False,False
"Martin is pasting pieces of square colored paper of equal size onto a board measuring 72 cm by 90 cm. If only whole square pieces are used, and the board is to be completely covered, what is the largest possible length of the side of each square colored paper?",18.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Martin is pasting pieces of square colored paper of equal size onto a board measuring 72 cm by 90 cm. If only whole square pieces are used, and the board is to be completely covered, what is the largest possible length of the side of each square colored paper?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the board:

Area of board = length x width = 72 cm x 90 cm = 6,480 cm²

Next, we need to find the area of each square colored paper. Let's call the side length of each square ""x"".

Area of each square paper = x²

Now, we need to figure out how many squares we can fit onto the board. We can do this by dividing the area of the board by the area of each square paper:

Number of squares = Area of board / Area of each square paper
Number of squares = 6,480 cm² / x²

Since we can only use whole square pieces, the number of squares must be a whole number. Let's call this number ""n"".

n = 6,480 cm² / x²

Now, we want to maximize the side length ""x"". This means we want to minimize the number of squares ""n"". The largest possible value of ""x"" will occur when ""n"" is minimized and is a whole number.

We can try different values of ""n"" to see which one gives us a whole number for ""x"". For example:

n = 1: x² = 6,480 cm²
x ≈ 80.5 cm (not a whole number)

n = 2: x² = 3,240 cm²
x ≈ 57 cm (not a whole number)

n = 3: x² = 2,160 cm²
x ≈ 46.5 cm (not a whole number)

n = 4: x² = 1,620 cm²
x ≈ 40.2 cm (not a whole number)

n = 5: x² = 1,296 cm²
x ≈ 36 cm (a whole number!)

Therefore, the largest possible length of the side of each square colored paper is 36 cm. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",36,False,False
Two wires with lengths of 448 cm and 616 cm are to be cut into pieces of all the same length without remainder. What is the greatest possible length of the pieces?,56.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Two wires with lengths of 448 cm and 616 cm are to be cut into pieces of all the same length without remainder. What is the greatest possible length of the pieces?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 448 and 616. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to do this:

616 = 1 x 448 + 168
448 = 2 x 168 + 112
168 = 1 x 112 + 56
112 = 2 x 56 + 0

The last non-zero remainder is 56, so GCD(448, 616) = 56.

Now we know that the pieces must have a length that is a divisor of 56. The divisors of 56 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, and 56.

We want to find the greatest possible length of the pieces, so we choose the largest divisor, which is 56. Therefore, we can cut both wires into pieces of length 56 cm without any remainder. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",56 cm.,False,False
"Janice and Jasmine were each given a piece of ribbon of equal length. Janice cuts her ribbons into equal lengths of 2 m, while Jasmine cuts her ribbons into equal lengths of 5 m. If there was no remainder in both cases, what is the shortest possible length of ribbon given to them?",10.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Janice and Jasmine were each given a piece of ribbon of equal length. Janice cuts her ribbons into equal lengths of 2 m, while Jasmine cuts her ribbons into equal lengths of 5 m. If there was no remainder in both cases, what is the shortest possible length of ribbon given to them?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the common factor of 2 and 5, which is 10. 

This means that the length of the ribbon given to Janice and Jasmine must be a multiple of 10. 

To find the shortest possible length, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 5, which is 10. 

Therefore, the shortest possible length of ribbon given to them is 10 meters. 

This means that Janice would have 5 pieces of ribbon, each 2 meters long, and Jasmine would have 2 pieces of ribbon, each 5 meters long. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10,False,False
"On a track for remote-controlled racing cars, racing car A completes the track in 28 seconds, while racing car B completes it in 24 seconds. If they both start at the same time, after how many seconds will they be side by side again?",168.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: On a track for remote-controlled racing cars, racing car A completes the track in 28 seconds, while racing car B completes it in 24 seconds. If they both start at the same time, after how many seconds will they be side by side again?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for racing car A to complete one lap more than racing car B. We can do this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 24 and 28:

- The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 x 3.
- The prime factorization of 28 is 2^2 x 7.
- The LCM of 24 and 28 is 2^3 x 3 x 7 = 168.

So racing car A completes one lap more than racing car B every 168 seconds.

Next, we need to find how many laps each car completes in 168 seconds:

- Racing car A completes 168/28 = 6 laps.
- Racing car B completes 168/24 = 7 laps.

This means that after 168 seconds, racing car B will be one lap ahead of racing car A.

Finally, we need to find how many seconds it takes for racing car A to catch up to racing car B, which is the time it takes for racing car A to complete one lap less than racing car B. Since racing car B completes one lap more than racing car A every 168 seconds, racing car A completes one lap less than racing car B every 168/2 = 84 seconds.

Therefore, racing car A will catch up to racing car B after 84 seconds. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",84,False,False
Samantha has two pieces of cloth. One piece is 72 inches wide and the other piece is 90 inches wide. She wants to cut both pieces into strips of equal width that are as wide as possible. How wide should she cut the strips?,18.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Samantha has two pieces of cloth. One piece is 72 inches wide and the other piece is 90 inches wide. She wants to cut both pieces into strips of equal width that are as wide as possible. How wide should she cut the strips?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 90. 

72 = 2^3 x 3^2 
90 = 2 x 3^2 x 5 

The common factors are 2 and 3^2, so the GCD is 2 x 3^2 = 18. 

This means that Samantha can cut strips that are 18 inches wide from both pieces of cloth. 

For the 72-inch wide cloth, she can cut 4 strips of 18 inches wide (72 ÷ 18 = 4). 

For the 90-inch wide cloth, she can cut 5 strips of 18 inches wide (90 ÷ 18 = 5). 

Therefore, Samantha should cut the strips 18 inches wide to make the most of both pieces of cloth. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",18,False,False
Rosa is making a game board that is 16 inches by 24 inches. She wants to use square tiles. What is the largest tile she can use?,8.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Rosa is making a game board that is 16 inches by 24 inches. She wants to use square tiles. What is the largest tile she can use?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 16 and 24. 

The factors of 16 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. 

The factors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. 

The common factors are: 1, 2, 4, 8. 

Therefore, the GCF of 16 and 24 is 8. 

This means that the game board can be divided into 8 equal squares of 2 inches by 2 inches. 

So, the largest tile Rosa can use is a 2-inch by 2-inch square tile. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2 inches.,False,False
I am planting 50 apple trees and 30 peach trees. I want the same number and type of trees per row. What is the maximum number of trees I can plant per row?,10.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: I am planting 50 apple trees and 30 peach trees. I want the same number and type of trees per row. What is the maximum number of trees I can plant per row?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 50 and 30 to determine the maximum number of trees per row that is divisible by both numbers. 

The prime factorization of 50 is 2 x 5 x 5, and the prime factorization of 30 is 2 x 3 x 5. 

To find the GCF, we need to identify the common factors and choose the highest exponent for each prime factor. 

The common factors are 2 and 5, and the highest exponent for 2 is 1, while the highest exponent for 5 is also 1. Therefore, the GCF of 50 and 30 is 2 x 5 = 10. 

This means that the maximum number of trees per row is 10, and we can plant 5 apple trees and 3 peach trees per row. 

To plant all 80 trees, we would need 10 rows of 8 trees each, with 5 apple trees and 3 peach trees in each row. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10,False,False
"Three pieces of timber 42 m, 49 m and 63 m long have to be divided into planks of the same length. What is the greatest possible length of each plank?",7.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Three pieces of timber 42 m, 49 m and 63 m long have to be divided into planks of the same length. What is the greatest possible length of each plank?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three given lengths of timber. 

The prime factorization of 42 is 2 x 3 x 7. 
The prime factorization of 49 is 7 x 7. 
The prime factorization of 63 is 3 x 3 x 7. 

To find the GCD, we need to find the common factors of all three numbers and multiply them together. The only common factor is 7, so the GCD is 7. 

Next, we need to divide each length of timber by the GCD to get the number of planks we can get of the same length. 

42 ÷ 7 = 6 
49 ÷ 7 = 7 
63 ÷ 7 = 9 

So we can get 6, 7, or 9 planks of the same length from each piece of timber. 

To find the greatest possible length of each plank, we need to divide the length of each piece of timber by the maximum number of planks we can get. 

For the first piece of timber: 
42 ÷ 6 = 7 

For the second piece of timber: 
49 ÷ 7 = 7 

For the third piece of timber: 
63 ÷ 9 = 7 

Therefore, the greatest possible length of each plank is 7 meters. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",7 meters.,False,False

What is the width of the widest strips of fabric you can cut from either bolt without wasting any of the fabric if each strip has the same width?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 45 and 60. 

The factors of 45 are: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45. 

The factors of 60 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60. 

The common factors are: 1, 3, 5, 15. 

The greatest common factor is 15. 

This means that we can cut strips of fabric that are 15 inches wide from either bolt without wasting any fabric. 

Therefore, the width of the widest strips of fabric we can cut from either bolt without wasting any fabric is 15 inches. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",15,False,False
"The parents are making sandwiches for the class picnic. They have 72 turkey slices, 48 cheese slices, and 96 tomato slices. What is the greatest number of sandwiches they can make if each sandwich has the same filling?",24.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: The parents are making sandwiches for the class picnic. They have 72 turkey slices, 48 cheese slices, and 96 tomato slices. What is the greatest number of sandwiches they can make if each sandwich has the same filling?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many sandwiches we can make with the turkey slices. If each sandwich has one turkey slice, we can make 72 sandwiches.

Next, we need to figure out how many sandwiches we can make with the cheese slices. If each sandwich has one cheese slice, we can make 48 sandwiches.

Finally, we need to figure out how many sandwiches we can make with the tomato slices. If each sandwich has one tomato slice, we can make 96 sandwiches.

However, we need to make sure that we use up all of the fillings evenly. In other words, we need to find the greatest common factor of 72, 48, and 96.

The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 x 3^2.
The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 x 3.
The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 x 3.

The greatest common factor is 2^3 x 3 = 24.

Therefore, the parents can make 72/24 = 3 sandwiches with turkey, 48/24 = 2 sandwiches with cheese, and 96/24 = 4 sandwiches with tomato.

Since we can only make as many sandwiches as the smallest number, the greatest number of sandwiches we can make is 2. Therefore, the parents can make 2 sandwiches with each filling, for a total of 6 sandwiches. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6,False,False
Two bicycle enthusiasts are leaving Cincinnati at the same time. One is biking 840 miles to Boston. The other is biking 440 miles to Atlanta. What is the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day?,40.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Two bicycle enthusiasts are leaving Cincinnati at the same time. One is biking 840 miles to Boston. The other is biking 440 miles to Atlanta. What is the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 840 and 440. 

The prime factorization of 840 is 2^3 x 3 x 5 x 7, and the prime factorization of 440 is 2^3 x 5 x 11. 

To find the GCD, we take the product of the common prime factors with the lowest exponent: 

GCD = 2^3 x 5 = 40 

This means that the two cyclists need to cover 40 miles each day to cover equal distances. 

To find the maximum number of miles they can bike each day, we divide their total distance by 40: 

For the cyclist going to Boston: 840 miles / 40 miles per day = 21 days 

For the cyclist going to Atlanta: 440 miles / 40 miles per day = 11 days 

Therefore, the greatest number of miles they can bike each day is: 

For the cyclist going to Boston: 840 miles / 21 days = 40 miles per day 

For the cyclist going to Atlanta: 440 miles / 11 days = 40 miles per day 

So they can each bike a maximum of 40 miles per day if they want to cover equal distances each day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",40 miles per day.,True,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of flowers Jessica has: 

8 + 12 + 48 = 68 

So, Jessica has 68 flowers in total. 

Now, we need to find the number of arrangements she can make with those flowers. 

To do that, we can use the formula for permutations with repetition:

n1 = 8 (roses) 
n2 = 12 (daisies) 
n3 = 48 (marigolds) 

So, the number of arrangements is: 

68! / (8! * 12! * 48!) 

This is a big number, so we can use a calculator to find the answer: 

68! = 6.123445e+100 

8! = 40,320 

12! = 479,001,600 

48! = 1.241391e+61 

68! / (8! * 12! * 48!) = 6.123445e+100 / (40,320 * 479,001,600 * 1.241391e+61)

A teacher is to arrange 60 boys and 72 girls in rows. He wishes to arrange them in such a way that only boys or girls will be there in a row. Find the greatest number of students that could be arranged in a row.,12.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: A teacher is to arrange 60 boys and 72 girls in rows. He wishes to arrange them in such a way that only boys or girls will be there in a row. Find the greatest number of students that could be arranged in a row.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 60 and 72 to determine the maximum number of rows we can have with only boys or only girls. 

The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 x 3 x 5, and the prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 x 3^2. 

To find the GCD, we take the highest power of each common prime factor: 

GCD = 2^2 x 3 = 12 

So we can have a maximum of 5 rows of only boys (since 5 x 12 = 60) or 6 rows of only girls (since 6 x 12 = 72). 

Now we need to find the greatest number of students that could be arranged in a row. 

If we have only boys in a row, we have 60 boys to arrange. 

If we have only girls in a row, we have 72 girls to arrange. 

To maximize the number of students in a row, we want to divide the total number of students (60 + 72 = 132) evenly among the maximum number of rows. 

If we have 5 rows of only boys, each row would have 60/5 = 12 boys. 

If we have 6 rows of only girls, each row would have 72/6 = 12 girls. 

Therefore, the greatest number of students that could be arranged in a row is 12. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",12,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many points Chloe earned for recycling 28 pounds of paper. 

We know that for every 6 pounds recycled, they earn 1 point. So, we can set up a proportion: 

6 pounds : 1 point = 28 pounds : x points 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

6x = 28 

x = 28/6 

x = 4.67

Using the same proportion, we can set it up like this: 

6 pounds : 1 point = 2 pounds : y points 

Cross-multiplying: 

6y = 2 

y = 2/6 

y = 0.33 

So, Chloe's friends earned 0.33 points for recycling 2 pounds of paper.

"Faye's team won their baseball game and scored sixty-eight points total. If Faye scored twenty-eight of the points and everyone else scored eight points each, how many players were on her team?",5.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Faye's team won their baseball game and scored sixty-eight points total. If Faye scored twenty-eight of the points and everyone else scored eight points each, how many players were on her team?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Faye scored 28 points. 

Next, we need to figure out how many points were scored by the other players. We know that everyone else scored 8 points each. Let's call the number of other players ""x"". 

So the total number of points scored by the other players is 8x. 

Now we can set up an equation to represent the total number of points scored: 

28 + 8x = 68 

We can solve for x by subtracting 28 from both sides: 

8x = 40 

And then dividing both sides by 8: 

x = 5 

So there were 5 other players on Faye's team. 

To check our answer, we can verify that the total number of points scored is indeed 68: 

28 + 5(8) = 68 

28 + 40 = 68 

68 = 68

31 boxes ÷ 12 boxes/case = 2.58 cases

Step 2: Determine how many boxes will not be packed to a case.
Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round down to the nearest whole number of cases. This means that Deborah sold 2 cases of Lemon Chalet Cremes, leaving 7 boxes that will not be packed to a case.

Answer: 7 boxes will not be packed to a case. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",7,False,False
"Nancy sold 45 boxes of Tagalongs. How many cases of 12 boxes, plus extra boxes does Nancy need?",4.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Nancy sold 45 boxes of Tagalongs. How many cases of 12 boxes, plus extra boxes does Nancy need?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes in each case to find the number of full cases. 

45 boxes ÷ 12 boxes/case = 3.75 cases 

Since we can't have a fraction of a case, we know that Nancy needs 3 full cases. 

Step 2: Multiply the number of full cases by the number of boxes in each case to find the total number of boxes in those cases. 

3 cases × 12 boxes/case = 36 boxes 

So Nancy needs 36 boxes to fill the 3 full cases. 

Step 3: Subtract the number of boxes in the full cases from the total number of boxes to find the number of extra boxes. 

45 boxes - 36 boxes = 9 extra boxes 

Therefore, Nancy needs 3 cases of 12 boxes each, plus 9 extra boxes. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3 cases + 9 extra boxes.,False,False

Note that we get a decimal answer, which means each friend cannot have exactly 3.5 Skittles. We'll deal with that in the next step. 

3. Samuel ate what was left. Since we can't divide Skittles into halves, Samuel must have eaten either 1 or 2 Skittles. Let's try both scenarios: 

- If Samuel ate 1 Skittle, then there are 14 - 1 = 13 Skittles left to share among the 4 friends. Dividing 13 Skittles equally gives: 

13 Skittles ÷ 4 friends = 3 with 1 Skittle left over 

So each friend would have eaten 3 Skittles, and there would be 1 Skittle left over. 

- If Samuel ate 2 Skittles, then there are 14 - 2 = 12 Skittles left to share among the 4 friends. Dividing 12 Skittles equally gives: 

12 Skittles ÷ 4 friends = 3 Skittles per friend 

So each friend would have eaten 3 Skittles exactly, with no Skittles left over. 

Therefore, depending on whether Samuel ate 1 or 2 Skittles, each person would have eaten either 3 Skittles with 1 left over or 3 Skittles exactly. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","either 3 with 1 left over or 3, depending on how many Skittles Samuel ate.",False,False

For the party, they prepared a few snacks for everyone. If his sister prepared 25 mini cupcakes and his mother prepared 30, how many did his grandmother prepare if they have a total of 100 cupcakes?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Kevin's sister and mother prepared together. We know that his sister prepared 25 cupcakes and his mother prepared 30 cupcakes. So, 25 + 30 = 55 cupcakes were prepared by Kevin's sister and mother.

Now, we know that there are a total of 100 cupcakes. To find out how many cupcakes Kevin's grandmother prepared, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes prepared by Kevin's sister and mother from the total number of cupcakes. So, 100 - 55 = 45 cupcakes were prepared by Kevin's grandmother. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",45.,,False

If he prepared 350 grams of chips and his father prepared 268 grams, how much chips should his brother prepare if they are to have 800 grams of chips?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many grams of chips they have already prepared. To do this, we add the grams of chips prepared by the boy and his father:

350 grams (prepared by the boy) + 268 grams (prepared by his father) = 618 grams

Now, we need to find out how many more grams of chips they need to reach 800 grams. To do this, we subtract the total grams of chips they have already prepared from 800 grams:

800 grams - 618 grams = 182 grams

So, the brother should prepare 182 grams of chips to reach a total of 800 grams. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",182.,,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that one neighbor brought 75 hotdogs. The other neighbor brought 25 less hotdogs than the first one, so they brought 75 - 25 = <<75-25=50>>50 hotdogs. To find the total number of hotdogs brought by the neighbors, we add the hotdogs brought by each neighbor: 75 + 50 = <<75+50=125>>125 hotdogs. So, the neighbors brought 125 hotdogs in total.

There she saw 532 species of insects, reptiles and birds. If she saw 253 insect species and 143 bird species, how many reptile species did she see?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many reptile species she saw. We know that she saw 532 species in total, and we know the number of insect and bird species she saw. So, we can find the number of reptile species by subtracting the number of insect and bird species from the total number of species.

Reptile species = Total species - Insect species - Bird species
Reptile species = 532 - 253 - 143

Now, let's do the math.

Reptile species = 532 - 253 - 143
Reptile species = 279 - 143
Reptile species = 136

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many shells are red or green. To do this, we add the number of red shells and green shells together: 76 red shells + 49 green shells = 125 red and green shells.

Now, we need to find out how many shells are not red or green. To do this, we subtract the number of red and green shells from the total number of shells: 291 total shells - 125 red and green shells = 166 shells that are not red or green. Answer: \boxed{166}.

She spent $347.00 on key chains and bracelets which is $146.00 more than she spent on t-shirts. How much money did she spend on all the souvenirs?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that she spent $146.00 more on key chains and bracelets than on t-shirts. So, let's call the amount she spent on t-shirts T. Then the amount she spent on key chains and bracelets would be T + $146.00.

We are given that she spent $347.00 on key chains and bracelets. So, T + $146.00 = $347.00.

Now, we can solve for T: T = $347.00 - $146.00 = $201.00.

So, she spent $201.00 on t-shirts.

Finally, to find the total amount she spent on all the souvenirs, we add the amount she spent on t-shirts, key chains, and bracelets: $201.00 + $347.00 = $<<201+347=548>>548.00. Answer: \boxed{548}. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",548.,,False

If she gave $175.00 to the first orphanage and $250.00 to the third, how much did she donate to the second orphanage?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that she donated a total of $650.00. She gave $175.00 to the first orphanage and $250.00 to the third orphanage. So, we can write the equation:

Total donations = Donation to first orphanage + Donation to second orphanage + Donation to third orphanage

$650.00 = $175.00 + Donation to second orphanage + $250.00

Now, we can combine the known donations:

$650.00 = $425.00 + Donation to second orphanage

To find the donation to the second orphanage, we can subtract the combined known donations from the total donations:

Donation to second orphanage = $650.00 - $425.00

Donation to second orphanage = $<<650-425=225>>225.00

So, she donated $225.00 to the second orphanage. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",225.,,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many boxes we need to hold all the chalk. To do this, we can divide the total number of chalk pieces by the number of pieces each box can hold:

3,484 pieces of chalk ÷ 18 pieces per box = 193.56 boxes

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, we need 194 boxes to hold all the chalk.

Now, let's find out how many boxes are full. Since we have 194 boxes and each box can hold 18 pieces of chalk, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces each box can hold:

194 boxes × 18 pieces per box = 3,492 pieces of chalk

However, we only have 3,484 pieces of chalk. So, we need to find out how many extra pieces of chalk we have:

3,492 pieces - 3,484 pieces = 8 extra pieces

Now, we can find out how many boxes are full by subtracting the extra pieces from the total number of boxes:

"A transport company bought 95 tons of oil. A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many large barrels should be used?",15.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: A transport company bought 95 tons of oil. A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many large barrels should be used?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 5, which is the smallest number that both 6 and 5 can divide into. The LCM of 6 and 5 is 30.

Now, we need to find the largest multiple of 30 that is less than or equal to 95. The largest multiple of 30 less than 95 is 90 (30 * 3).

So, we can use three large barrels (3 * 6 = 18 tons) and three small barrels (3 * 5 = 15 tons) to hold 90 tons of oil.

Now, we have 5 tons of oil left (95 - 90 = 5). We can use one more small barrel to hold the remaining 5 tons of oil.

In total, we should use 3 large barrels and 4 small barrels to hold 95 tons of oil with the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3.,,False

A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many small barrels should be used?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many large barrels can be used to store the oil. To do this, we can divide the total amount of oil by the capacity of a large barrel:

95 tons / 6 tons/barrel = 15.83 barrels

Since we can't have a fraction of a barrel, we can only use 15 large barrels. Now let's find out how much oil is left after filling these large barrels:

95 tons - (15 large barrels * 6 tons/barrel) = 95 tons - 90 tons = 5 tons

Now we can see that there are 5 tons of oil left, which is exactly the capacity of a small barrel. So, the transport company should use 1 small barrel to store the remaining oil. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1.,,False

In order to make the least number of pieces, how many long pieces should be cut for?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many long pieces can be cut from the 27-yard rope. To do this, we can divide the total length of the rope by the length of the long pieces:

27 yards / 4 yards = 6.75

Since we can't cut a fraction of a piece, we can only cut 6 long pieces from the rope. This will leave us with:

27 yards - (6 long pieces * 4 yards) = 27 yards - 24 yards = 3 yards

Now we have 3 yards left, which can be cut into 3 short pieces of 1 yard each.

So, the worker should cut 6 long pieces to make the least number of pieces. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6.,,False

A large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and small truck can load 7 tons. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many large trucks should be used?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of tons that can be loaded by both large and small trucks. Let's denote the number of large trucks as L and the number of small trucks as S. We have:

15L + 7S = 134

Now, we want to minimize the number of trucks, so we want to use as many large trucks as possible. Let's try to find the maximum number of large trucks that can be used.

The maximum number of large trucks that can be used is 134 tons divided by 15 tons per truck, which is:

134 / 15 = 8.93

Since we can't use a fraction of a truck, we can use at most 8 large trucks. Now let's see if we can find a combination of large and small trucks that will load exactly 134 tons.

If we use 8 large trucks, we have:

15 * 8 = 120 tons

We still need to load 14 tons, which can be done by using 2 small trucks:

7 * 2 = 14 tons

So, the combination of 8 large trucks and 2 small trucks will load exactly 134 tons. Therefore, Mr. Lee should use 8 large trucks. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8.,,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces of ribbon Sam cut. To do this, we'll divide the total length of the ribbon by the length of each piece. So, we have:

3,730 cm / 73 cm/piece = 51 pieces

Now, we need to find out how much ribbon was used to make these 51 pieces. To do this, we'll multiply the number of pieces by the length of each piece. So, we have:

51 pieces * 73 cm/piece = 3,723 cm

Finally, we need to find out how much of the original ribbon was left. To do this, we'll subtract the amount of ribbon used from the total length of the ribbon. So, we have:

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3, which is the smallest number that can be divided by both 2 and 3. The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6.

Now, we can divide the 26 people into groups of 6. There are 4 groups of 6 people and 1 group of 2 people left. In each group of 6 people, we can have 2 large rooms for 3 people each. So, for the 4 groups of 6 people, we need 4 * 2 = 8 large rooms.

For the remaining group of 2 people, we can't use a large room, so we need to use a small room for them.

In total, we need 8 large rooms and 1 small room to accommodate all 26 people. So, the hotel should rent 8 large rooms. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8.,,True

250 ÷ 12 = 20.8333

Since Gil can't take a fraction of a vitamin, we'll round down to 20 days. This means that Gil will have enough vitamins for 20 full days.

Now, let's find out how many vitamins Gil will have taken after 20 days.

20 days × 12 vitamins/day = 240 vitamins

Finally, we need to find out how many vitamins short Gil is on the day the bottle runs out. To do this, we can subtract the number of vitamins Gil has taken (240) from the total number of vitamins in the bottle (250).

164 rabbits / 17 cages = 9.647 rabbits per cage

Since we can't have a fraction of a rabbit, the farmer needs to have 10 rabbits in each cage. Now, we can find out how many rabbits the farmer needs in total to fill all 17 cages with 10 rabbits each.

17 cages * 10 rabbits per cage = 170 rabbits

Finally, we can find out how many more rabbits the farmer should buy by subtracting the number of rabbits he already has (164) from the total number of rabbits he needs (170).

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bureaus each office should get. To do this, we can divide the total number of bureaus by the number of offices:

88 bureaus ÷ 14 offices = 6 bureaus per office with a remainder of 4 bureaus.

Since there are 4 bureaus left, we need to distribute them equally among the offices. To do this, we can subtract the number of bureaus already distributed from the total number of bureaus needed:

14 offices - 4 bureaus = 10 offices.

Now, we need to find out how many more bureaus are needed for these 10 offices to have an equal number of bureaus. Since each office should have 6 bureaus, we can multiply the number of offices by the number of bureaus per office:

10 offices × 6 bureaus per office = 60 bureaus.

Finally, we can subtract the number of bureaus already distributed from the total number of bureaus needed:

60 bureaus - 4 bureaus = 56 bureaus.

So, at least 56 more bureaus are needed for each office to have an equal number of bureaus. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",56.,,False

If she wants to make 15 necklaces with each having the same number of beads, how many more beads does she need?",8.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: Betty has 367 beads and wants to use all the beads to make necklaces. If she wants to make 15 necklaces with each having the same number of beads, how many more beads does she need?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many beads each necklace will have. To do this, we can divide the total number of beads by the number of necklaces: 367 beads / 15 necklaces = 24 beads per necklace with a remainder of 7 beads.

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Betty needs to make all the necklaces have the same number of beads. Since there are 7 beads left over, she needs to add enough beads to make the remainder 0. 

To do this, we can subtract the remainder from the number of beads per necklace: 24 beads - 7 beads = 17 beads. 

Now, we can add 17 beads to the 7 beads left over to find out how many more beads Betty needs: 17 beads + 7 beads = 24 beads.

So, Betty needs 24 more beads to make all the necklaces have the same number of beads. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",24.,,False
"There are 315 cups of puddings to be distributed to 218 students.

If each of them wants an equal number of pudding cups, at least how many more pudding cups are needed?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cups of pudding each student will get. To do this, we divide the total number of pudding cups by the number of students:

315 cups ÷ 218 students = 1.44 cups per student

Since each student wants an equal number of pudding cups, we need to round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 cup per student. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","1. Now, we need to find out how many more pudding cups are needed to give each student 2 cups of pudding. To do this, we multiply the number of students by 2:

218 students × 2 cups per student = 436 cups

Now, we subtract the original number of pudding cups from the new total:

436 cups - 315 cups = 121 cups

So, at least 121 more pudding cups are needed.",,False
"Sam has 389 riddles for 18 of his students to guess.

If he wants the students to guess the same number of riddles, at least how many more riddles does he need to distribute?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many riddles each student will get if Sam distributes them equally. To do this, we can divide the total number of riddles by the number of students:

389 riddles ÷ 18 students = 21 riddles per student with a remainder of 11 riddles.

Now, we need to find out how many more riddles Sam needs to distribute so that each student gets the same number of riddles. Since there are 11 riddles left, Sam needs to add more riddles to make it a multiple of 18.

The next multiple of 18 after 11 is 18 itself. So, Sam needs to add 7 more riddles (18 - 11 = 7) to make it possible for each student to guess the same number of riddles.

Therefore, Sam needs at least 7 more riddles to distribute. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",7.,,False
"A school buys 1,093 chairs. If it wants to distribute them equally into 35 classrooms, how many more chairs should be purchased?",27.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: A school buys 1,093 chairs. If it wants to distribute them equally into 35 classrooms, how many more chairs should be purchased?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many chairs can be distributed equally among the 35 classrooms. To do this, we can divide the total number of chairs (1,093) by the number of classrooms (35).

1,093 ÷ 35 = 31.22857142857143

Since we can't have a fraction of a chair, we'll round down to 31 chairs per classroom. Now, we need to find out how many chairs will be distributed in total:

31 chairs per classroom × 35 classrooms = 1,085 chairs

The school has 1,093 chairs, but they need 1,085 chairs to distribute them equally. So, they have 8 extra chairs:

1,093 - 1,085 = 8

However, if the school wants to add one more chair to each classroom, they will need to purchase an additional 35 chairs:

35 classrooms × 1 chair = 35 chairs

Now, we can subtract the 8 extra chairs they already have:

35 - 8 = 27

So, the school should purchase 27 more chairs to distribute them equally among the 35 classrooms. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",27.,,False

How much heavier is a bag of chips than a bottle of juice?,350.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: The weight of 2 bags of chips is 800 g. The total weight of 5 such bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 g. How much heavier is a bag of chips than a bottle of juice?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of 5 bags of chips. Since 2 bags weigh 800 g, 5 bags will weigh (5/2) * 800 g = 2000 g. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","2000 g. Now, we know that the total weight of 5 bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 g, which is equal to 2200 g. So, the total weight of 4 bottles of juice is 2200 g - 2000 g = 200 g. 

Now, we can find the weight of one bottle of juice by dividing the total weight of 4 bottles by 4: 200 g / 4 = 50 g. 

Since one bag of chips weighs 400 g (800 g / 2), the difference in weight between a bag of chips and a bottle of juice is 400 g - 50 g = 350 g. So, a bag of chips is 350 g heavier than a bottle of juice.",,False
The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?,10.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the weight of one diamond. Since 5 diamonds weigh 100 g, we can divide 100 g by 5 to find the weight of one diamond:

100 g / 5 = 20 g

So, one diamond weighs 20 g.

Now, we know that 4 diamonds and 2 jades weigh 140 g. Since one diamond weighs 20 g, we can find the total weight of 4 diamonds:

4 * 20 g = 80 g

Now, we can subtract the total weight of 4 diamonds from the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades to find the total weight of 2 jades:

140 g - 80 g = 60 g

So, 2 jades weigh 60 g. To find the weight of one jade, we can divide 60 g by 2:

60 g / 2 = 30 g

So, one jade weighs 30 g.

Finally, we can subtract the weight of one diamond from the weight of one jade to find how much heavier a jade is than a diamond:

30 g - 20 g = 10 g

So, a jade is 10 g heavier than a diamond. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10.,,True

How much heavier is a double bed than a single bed?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 5 single beds weigh 50 kg. So, the weight of 1 single bed is 50 kg / 5 = 10 kg.

Now, we know that 2 single beds and 4 double beds weigh 100 kg. Since 1 single bed weighs 10 kg, the weight of 2 single beds is 2 * 10 kg = 20 kg.

So, the total weight of 4 double beds is 100 kg - 20 kg = 80 kg. Therefore, the weight of 1 double bed is 80 kg / 4 = 20 kg.

Finally, to find out how much heavier a double bed is than a single bed, we subtract the weight of a single bed from the weight of a double bed: 20 kg - 10 kg = 10 kg.

A double bed is 10 kg heavier than a single bed. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10.,,False
The weight of 3 glass bottles is 600 g. The total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1 kg 50 g.

How much heavier is a glass bottle than a plastic bottle?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the weight of 1 glass bottle. Since 3 glass bottles weigh 600 g, we can divide 600 g by 3 to find the weight of 1 glass bottle:

600 g ÷ 3 = 200 g

So, 1 glass bottle weighs 200 g. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","200 g.

Now, we need to find the total weight of 4 glass bottles. Since 1 glass bottle weighs 200 g, we can multiply 200 g by 4:

200 g × 4 = 800 g

So, 4 glass bottles weigh 800 g.

Next, we need to find the total weight of 5 plastic bottles. We know that the total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1 kg 50 g, which is equal to 1050 g. So, we can subtract the total weight of 4 glass bottles from the total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles:

1050 g - 800 g = 250 g

So, the total weight of 5 plastic bottles is 250 g.

Now, we need to find the weight of 1 plastic bottle. Since 5 plastic bottles weigh 250 g, we can divide 250 g by 5:

250 g ÷ 5 = 50 g

So, 1 plastic bottle weighs 50 g.

Finally, we need to find how much heavier a glass bottle is than a plastic bottle. We can subtract the weight of 1 plastic bottle from the weight of 1 glass bottle:

200 g - 50 g = 150 g

So, a glass bottle is 150 g heavier than a plastic bottle.",,False
The weight of 5 foxes is 25 kg. The total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg. How much heavier is a dog than a fox?,5.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: The weight of 5 foxes is 25 kg. The total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg. How much heavier is a dog than a fox?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the weight of one fox. Since 5 foxes weigh 25 kg, we can divide 25 kg by 5 foxes to find the weight of one fox: 25 kg / 5 foxes = 5 kg/fox. So, one fox weighs 5 kg.

Next, we need to find the total weight of the 3 foxes. Since one fox weighs 5 kg, we can multiply 5 kg/fox by 3 foxes to find the total weight of the 3 foxes: 5 kg/fox * 3 foxes = 15 kg.

Now, we know that the total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg. Since the 3 foxes weigh 15 kg, we can subtract their weight from the total weight to find the total weight of the 5 dogs: 65 kg - 15 kg = 50 kg. So, the 5 dogs weigh 50 kg.

Finally, we need to find the weight of one dog. Since 5 dogs weigh 50 kg, we can divide 50 kg by 5 dogs to find the weight of one dog: 50 kg / 5 dogs = 10 kg/dog. So, one dog weighs 10 kg.

To find how much heavier a dog is than a fox, we can subtract the weight of a fox from the weight of a dog: 10 kg/dog - 5 kg/fox = 5 kg. So, a dog is 5 kg heavier than a fox. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5.,,False

How much heavier is a watermelon than a pineapple?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the weight of one watermelon. Since 4 watermelons weigh 5 kg 200 g, we can divide the total weight by 4 to find the weight of one watermelon:

5 kg 200 g = 5200 g (converting to grams)
5200 g ÷ 4 = 1300 g

So, one watermelon weighs 1300 g.

Next, we need to find the total weight of the 3 watermelons:

3 watermelons × 1300 g = 3900 g

Now, we know that the total weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples is 5 kg 700 g, which is equal to 5700 g. So, we can subtract the total weight of the 3 watermelons from this amount to find the total weight of the 4 pineapples:

5700 g - 3900 g = 1800 g

Now, we can divide the total weight of the 4 pineapples by 4 to find the weight of one pineapple:

1800 g ÷ 4 = 450 g

Finally, we can subtract the weight of one pineapple from the weight of one watermelon to find the difference:

800 g ÷ 4 = 200 g

Now, we know that 1 cake weighs 200 g, so 3 cakes weigh:

3 × 200 g = 600 g

Next, we need to find the total weight of 5 pieces of bread. We know that the total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1 kg 100 g, which is equal to 1100 g. So, the total weight of 5 pieces of bread is:

1100 g - 600 g = 500 g

Now, we can find the weight of 1 piece of bread by dividing the total weight of 5 pieces of bread by 5:

500 g ÷ 5 = 100 g

Finally, we can find how much heavier a cake is than a piece of bread by subtracting the weight of a piece of bread from the weight of a cake:

Annette and Caitlin weigh 95 pounds together. Caitlin and Sara weigh 87 pounds together. How much more does Annette weigh than Sara?,8.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: Annette and Caitlin weigh 95 pounds together. Caitlin and Sara weigh 87 pounds together. How much more does Annette weigh than Sara?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's use variables to represent the unknown weights. Let A be Annette's weight, C be Caitlin's weight, and S be Sara's weight. We are given the following information:

1) A + C = 95
2) C + S = 87

We want to find the difference between Annette's and Sara's weights, or A - S. To do this, we can first solve for one of the variables in one of the equations. Let's solve for Caitlin's weight (C) in the first equation:

A + C = 95
C = 95 - A

Now, we can substitute this expression for C in the second equation:

(95 - A) + S = 87

Now, we can solve for A - S:

95 - A + S = 87
- A + S = -8
A - S = 8

So, Annette weighs 8 pounds more than Sara. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8.,,False
Kyle bought 3 presents. The first present cost $18. The second present cost $7 more than the first. The third present cost $11 less than the first. How much did Kyle pay for all 3 presents?,50.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: Kyle bought 3 presents. The first present cost $18. The second present cost $7 more than the first. The third present cost $11 less than the first. How much did Kyle pay for all 3 presents?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the cost of the second present. Since it cost $7 more than the first present, we can add $7 to the cost of the first present: $18 + $7 = $<<18+7=25>>25. So the second present cost $25.

Next, we need to find the cost of the third present. Since it cost $11 less than the first present, we can subtract $11 from the cost of the first present: $18 - $11 = $<<18-11=7>>7. So the third present cost $7.

Finally, we need to add the cost of all three presents to find the total cost: $18 + $25 + $7 = $<<18+25+7=50>>50. So Kyle paid $50 for all 3 presents. Answer: \boxed{50}. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",50.,,False
Three paper bags contain a total of 24 apples. The first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples. The second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples. How many apples are in the first and third bags together?,19.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: Three paper bags contain a total of 24 apples. The first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples. The second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples. How many apples are in the first and third bags together?

A: Let's think step by step. Let the number of apples in the first, second, and third bags be x, y, and z, respectively. We have the following equations:

x + y = 11 (1)
y + z = 18 (2)

We want to find the value of x + z. To do this, we can first solve for y in equation (1):

y = 11 - x

Now, substitute this expression for y in equation (2):

(11 - x) + z = 18

Simplify the equation:

11 - x + z = 18

Now, add x to both sides of the equation:

11 + z = 18 + x

Subtract 11 from both sides:

z = 7 + x

Now we have an expression for z in terms of x. Since we know that x + y + z = 24 (the total number of apples), we can substitute the expressions for y and z back into this equation:

x + (11 - x) + (7 + x) = 24

Simplify the equation:

x + 11 - x + 7 + x = 24

Combine like terms:

11 + 7 = 24 - x

18 = 24 - x

Now, add x to both sides:

x + 18 = 24

Subtract 18 from both sides:

x = 6

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of z:

z = 7 + x
z = 7 + 6
z = 13

So, the first and third bags together contain x + z = 6 + 13 = 19 apples. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",19.,,False
A worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep. It climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?,5.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: A worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep. It climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?

A: Let's think step by step. On the first day, the worm climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches, so it is 5 inches higher than before. 

Now, let's think about the last day. When the worm is 3 inches away from the top, it will climb up 8 inches and reach the top without sliding back. So, we need to find out how many days it takes for the worm to be 3 inches away from the top.

The hole is 26 inches deep, so the worm needs to climb 26 - 3 = 23 inches to be 3 inches away from the top. Since the worm climbs 5 inches per day (8 inches up and 3 inches back), it will take 23 / 5 = 4.6 days to reach that point. Since the worm can't take a fraction of a day, we round up to 5 days.

So, it will take the worm 5 days to be 3 inches away from the top, and on the 6th day, it will climb up the remaining 8 inches and reach the top. Therefore, it will take the worm 6 days to reach the top. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6.,,False
"Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh 90 pounds altogether. Rita and Peter know they weigh the same amount. Peter and Skeeter know they weigh 68 pounds together. How much does Skeeter weigh?",46.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh 90 pounds altogether. Rita and Peter know they weigh the same amount. Peter and Skeeter know they weigh 68 pounds together. How much does Skeeter weigh?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Rita and Peter weigh the same amount. Let's call their weight R and P, respectively. So, R = P.

Second, we know that Peter and Skeeter weigh 68 pounds together. Let's call Skeeter's weight S. So, P + S = 68.

Third, we know that Rita, Peter, and Skeeter weigh 90 pounds altogether. So, R + P + S = 90.

Now, we can use these equations to solve for Skeeter's weight (S).

Since R = P, we can substitute R with P in the third equation:

P + P + S = 90
2P + S = 90

Now, we know that P + S = 68, so we can substitute this into the equation:

2P + (P + S) = 90
3P = 90 - 68
3P = 22
P = 22/3

Now we know that Peter weighs 22/3 pounds. To find Skeeter's weight, we can use the equation P + S = 68:

22/3 + S = 68
S = 68 - 22/3
S = 62/3

So, Skeeter weighs 62/3 pounds. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",20.67 pounds.,,False
"A new store opened up at the mall. During the first hour, 94 people came in and 27 people left. During the second hour, 18 people came in and 9 people left.

During the second hour, 18 people came in and 9 people left. How many people were still in the store after 2 hours?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people were in the store after the first hour. To do this, we subtract the number of people who left from the number of people who came in: 94 - 27 = 67 people.

Now, we need to find out how many people were in the store after the second hour. To do this, we add the number of people who came in during the second hour to the number of people who were already in the store, and then subtract the number of people who left during the second hour: 67 + 18 - 9 = 76 people.

So, there were 76 people still in the store after 2 hours. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",76.,,False
"Ben had some baseball cards. His friend, Tim, had 20 cards. After Ben bought 3 more cards, he had twice as many cards as Tim.

How many cards did Ben have at first?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ben bought 3 more cards and then had twice as many cards as Tim. So, if we let x be the number of cards Ben had at first, then after buying 3 more cards, he had x + 3 cards.

Since Ben had twice as many cards as Tim after buying 3 more cards, we can write the equation: x + 3 = 2 * 20.

Now, we can solve for x:

x + 3 = 40
x = 40 - 3
x = 37

So, Ben had 37 cards at first. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",37.,,False
"Alex, Brad, Calvin, and Dennis are playing checkers. Each of the 4 boys played 2 games with every other player.

How many games of checkers were played altogether?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's see how many games each player played. Since each of them played 2 games with every other player, and there are 3 other players, each of them played 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 games.

Now, we have to be careful not to count each game twice. If we simply add up the games played by each player, we would get 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24 games. However, each game involves two players, so we have counted each game twice.

To get the actual number of games played, we need to divide the total number of games by 2. So, there were 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 games of checkers played altogether. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",12.,,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Paul put 25 apples in the refrigerator and had 6 apples left for muffins. So, there were 25 + 6 = <<25+6=31>>31 apples after he put half of them aside for a pie.

Now, we know that these 31 apples are the other half of the apples that were not put aside for the pie. So, to find the total number of apples in the box, we can multiply this number by 2: 31 * 2 = <<31*2=62>>62 apples. 

Therefore, there were 62 apples in the box at first. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",62.,,True
"Megan and her sister, Tara, wanted to buy a scooter for $26. Tara had $4 more than Megan. Together they had enough money to buy the scooter. How much money did Tara have?",15.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: Megan and her sister, Tara, wanted to buy a scooter for $26. Tara had $4 more than Megan. Together they had enough money to buy the scooter. How much money did Tara have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's use a variable to represent the amount of money Megan has. Let's call it M. Since Tara has $4 more than Megan, we can represent Tara's money as M + $4.

Now, we know that together they have enough money to buy the scooter, which costs $26. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:

M + (M + $4) = $26

Now, we can solve this equation to find the value of M:

2M + $4 = $26

Subtract $4 from both sides of the equation:

2M = $22

Now, divide both sides by 2:

M = $11

So, Megan has $11. Since Tara has $4 more than Megan, Tara has:

$11 + $4 = $15

Tara has $15. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",15.,,False

Kira has $1.20 in quarters and dimes. She has minimized coins altogether. How many coins does she have?,6.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: Kira has $1.20 in quarters and dimes. She has minimized coins altogether. How many coins does she have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many quarters Kira has. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we can divide $1.20 by $0.25 to find out how many quarters she has. 

$1.20 ÷ $0.25 = 4.8

Since Kira can't have a fraction of a coin, she must have 4 quarters. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after the quarters.

4 quarters × $0.25 = $1.00

$1.20 - $1.00 = $0.20

Now, let's find out how many dimes Kira has. Since each dime is worth $0.10, we can divide $0.20 by $0.10 to find out how many dimes she has.

$0.20 ÷ $0.10 = 2

So, Kira has 2 dimes. In total, she has 4 quarters and 2 dimes, which means she has 4 + 2 = 6 coins. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6.,,False

Then she filled the remaining space with 4 L of blue paint. How many milliliters of paint did Gina mix?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total amount of paint in the container. Since Gina filled up one third of the container with red paint and the remaining space with 4 L of blue paint, we can say that 4 L of blue paint is equal to two thirds of the container. 

Now, we can set up a proportion to find the total amount of paint in the container:

(4 L blue paint) / (2/3 container) = (Total amount of paint) / (1 container)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

4 L * 1 = (Total amount of paint) * (2/3)

4 L = (2/3) * (Total amount of paint)

To solve for the total amount of paint, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2:

(3/2) * 4 L = (Total amount of paint)

6 L = (Total amount of paint)

How much does he get from the 1st job if he gets per week a total of $3,875?

A: Let's think step by step. Let x be the amount Mila's father gets from the 2nd job. Then the amount he gets from the 1st job is x + $375. The total amount he gets per week is $3,875. So we can write the equation:

x + (x + $375) = $3,875

Now we can solve for x:

2x + $375 = $3,875

Subtract $375 from both sides:

2x = $3,500

Divide both sides by 2:

x = $1,750

Now we know that Mila's father gets $1,750 from the 2nd job. To find out how much he gets from the 1st job, we can plug this value back into the equation:

1st job = x + $375 = $1,750 + $375 = $2,125

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the ratio of boys to girls is 8:5. This means that for every 8 boys, there are 5 girls. We also know that there are 30 girls at the basketball game. To find out how many boys there are, we can set up a proportion:

(boys / girls) = (8 / 5)

We know that there are 30 girls, so we can plug that into our proportion:

(boys / 30) = (8 / 5)

Now we can solve for the number of boys. To do this, we can cross-multiply:

5 * boys = 8 * 30

5 * boys = 240

Now we can divide by 5 to find the number of boys:

boys = 240 / 5

boys = 48

So there are 48 boys at the basketball game. To find out how many more boys there are than girls, we can subtract the number of girls from the number of boys:

If Andrew walks 150 steps, how many steps does Jeffrey walk?

A: Let's think step by step. If the ratio of Andrew's steps to Jeffrey's steps is 3:4, this means that for every 3 steps Andrew takes, Jeffrey takes 4 steps. 

Now, we know that Andrew has taken 150 steps. To find out how many steps Jeffrey has taken, we can set up a proportion:

(Andrew's steps / Jeffrey's steps) = (3 / 4)

We can plug in the number of steps Andrew has taken:

(150 / Jeffrey's steps) = (3 / 4)

Now, we can solve for Jeffrey's steps by cross-multiplying:

3 * Jeffrey's steps = 150 * 4

3 * Jeffrey's steps = 600

Now, we can divide by 3 to find Jeffrey's steps:

He wants to make fruit baskets with the same number of each fruit in each basket. What is the greatest number of fruit baskets he can make?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of each fruit Peter has. The GCD is the largest number that can divide all three numbers without leaving a remainder.

The prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3 (2 * 3 * 3).
The prime factors of 27 are 3, 3, and 3 (3 * 3 * 3).
The prime factors of 12 are 2, 2, and 3 (2 * 2 * 3).

The common prime factors are 3. So, the GCD is 3.

Now, we know that Peter can make fruit baskets with 3 of each fruit in each basket. To find the total number of fruit baskets, we can divide the number of each fruit by the GCD:

18 oranges / 3 = 6 baskets
27 pears / 3 = 9 baskets
12 bananas / 3 = 4 baskets

Since Peter wants the same number of each fruit in each basket, he can make 6 fruit baskets with 3 of each fruit in each basket. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6.,,False

If each luggage compartment will hold 5 pieces of luggage, how many will be in the compartment that isn't full?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many compartments will be completely full. To do this, we can divide the total number of luggage pieces by the number of pieces each compartment can hold: 41 / 5 = 8.2. Since we can't have a fraction of a compartment, we know that 8 compartments will be completely full.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces of luggage are in those 8 full compartments. To do this, we can multiply the number of full compartments by the number of pieces each compartment can hold: 8 * 5 = 40.

Now, we can subtract the number of pieces in the full compartments from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces are in the compartment that isn't full: 41 - 40 = 1.

So, there will be 1 piece of luggage in the compartment that isn't full. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1.,,False

If each pizza got 2 pieces, how many extra pieces of pepperoni would they have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pizzas can be made with the given pepperoni. To do this, we divide the total number of pepperoni pieces (11) by the number of pieces per pizza (2).

11 ÷ 2 = 5.5

Since we can't make half a pizza, we can only make 5 full pizzas with the given pepperoni.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of pepperoni were used for these 5 pizzas. To do this, we multiply the number of pizzas (5) by the number of pieces per pizza (2).

5 × 2 = 10

So, 10 pieces of pepperoni were used for the 5 pizzas.

Finally, we need to find out how many extra pieces of pepperoni are left. To do this, we subtract the number of pieces used (10) from the total number of pieces (11).

11 - 10 = 1

If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tickets each friend would get if they split the 27 tickets equally. To do this, we divide the total number of tickets (27) by the number of friends (6): 27 ÷ 6 = 4.5. Since they can't split a ticket in half, each friend would need 5 tickets to have an equal share.

Now, we need to find out how many tickets they need to buy to reach this equal share. We multiply the number of friends (6) by the number of tickets each friend needs (5): 6 × 5 = 30. So, they need a total of 30 tickets.

Finally, we subtract the number of tickets they already have (27) from the total number of tickets they need (30): 30 - 27 = 3. They need to buy 3 more tickets for each friend to have an equal share. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3.,,False

If they wanted to have 4 team, with the same number of students on each team, how many more students would need to sign up?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are needed for each team to have the same number of students. To do this, we can divide the total number of students needed by the number of teams. Let's call the number of students needed for each team ""x"".

14 + x = 4 * x

Now, we can solve for x:

14 = 3 * x
x = 14 / 3
x = 4.6667 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, each team needs 5 students.

Now, we can find out how many more students need to sign up by multiplying the number of students needed for each team by the number of teams and then subtracting the number of students who have already signed up:

(5 * 4) - 14 = 20 - 14 = 6

So, 6 more students would need to sign up for the trivia teams. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6.,,False

Lemon heads come in packages of 5. Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?,3.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: Lemon heads come in packages of 5. Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many packages of Lemon Heads Ann had. To do this, we can divide the total number of Lemon Heads she ate (78) by the number of Lemon Heads in each package (5).

78 ÷ 5 = 15.6

Since we can't have a fraction of a package, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 16. So, Ann had 16 packages of Lemon Heads.

Now, let's find out how many Lemon Heads are in 16 packages. To do this, we can multiply the number of packages (16) by the number of Lemon Heads in each package (5).

16 × 5 = 80

So, there were 80 Lemon Heads in total.

Finally, we can subtract the number of Lemon Heads Ann ate (78) from the total number of Lemon Heads (80) to find out how many she has left.

80 - 78 = 2

Ann has 2 Lemon Heads left. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2.,,False

64 ÷ 7 = 9.14

Since Stephen can't eat a fraction of a package, we'll round down to 9 packages.

Now, let's find out how many Sweettarts are in 9 packages.

9 × 7 = 63

Stephen ate 63 Sweettarts, which is one less than the 64 he started with.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many packages of jawbreakers Sarah had. Since each package has 8 jawbreakers, we can divide the total number of jawbreakers she ate (20) by the number of jawbreakers in each package (8).

20 ÷ 8 = 2.5

This means Sarah had 2.5 packages of jawbreakers. However, we can't have half a package, so we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 packages.

Now, let's find out how many jawbreakers are in 3 packages.

3 packages × 8 jawbreakers per package = 24 jawbreakers

Finally, we can subtract the number of jawbreakers Sarah ate (20) from the total number of jawbreakers she had (24).

24 - 20 = 4

So, Sarah has 4 jawbreakers left. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4.,,True

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's use variables to represent the ages of Ana and Jack. Let A be Ana's age and J be Jack's age. We know that Ana is 5 years older than Jack, so we can write the equation:

A = J + 5

We also know that the sum of their ages is 29, so we can write another equation:

A + J = 29

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

A = J + 5
A + J = 29

We can solve this system by substitution. Since A = J + 5, we can substitute J + 5 for A in the second equation:

(J + 5) + J = 29

Now we can solve for J:

2J + 5 = 29
2J = 24
J = 12

Devon's age = (1/2) * Steven's age + 2

Now, we know that Devon is 12 years old. So, we can substitute this into the equation:

12 = (1/2) * Steven's age + 2

Now, we need to solve for Steven's age. First, let's subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

12 - 2 = (1/2) * Steven's age

10 = (1/2) * Steven's age

Now, we need to get rid of the fraction. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

A: Let's think step by step. Since Nick and Kane were born on consecutive years, their ages differ by 1 year. Let's call Nick's age N and Kane's age K. Then, K = N + 1. 

We also know that the sum of their ages is 11, so N + K = 11. 

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation: N + (N + 1) = 11. 

Combining the terms, we get 2N + 1 = 11. 

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we have 2N = 10. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that N = 5.

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's use the information that Tony is two years younger than Teddy. We can represent this as:

Tony's age = Teddy's age - 2

Now, we know that the sum of their ages equals their mother's age, which is 42. So:

Tony's age + Teddy's age = 42

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

(Teddy's age - 2) + Teddy's age = 42

Now, we can solve for Teddy's age:

2 * Teddy's age - 2 = 42

2 * Teddy's age = 44

A: Let's think step by step. Let A be Allen's current age and S be Scott's current age. We know that Allen is 10 years younger than Scott, so we can write the equation:

A = S - 10

Five years from now, Scott's age will be 2 times the present age of Allen. In five years, Scott will be S + 5 years old, and 2 times Allen's current age is 2A. So we can write the equation:

S + 5 = 2A

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

A = S - 10
S + 5 = 2A

We can solve this system by substitution. Since A = S - 10, we can substitute A in the second equation:

S + 5 = 2(S - 10)

Now we can solve for S:

S + 5 = 2S - 20
20 + 5 = 2S - S
25 = S

So Scott's current age is 25 years old. Now we can find Allen's age by substituting S back into the first equation:

A = 25 - 10
A = 15

So Allen's current age is 15 years old. Therefore, Allen is 15 years old and Scott is 25 years old. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",15 and 25.,,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's denote the base angles as x. Since the vertex angle is twice either base angle, it will be 2x. Now, we know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

x + x + 2x = 180

Now, let's solve for x. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","4x = 180
x = 45

So, the base angles are both 45 degrees, and the vertex angle is 2x = 90 degrees. The angles of the triangle are 45, 45, and 90 degrees.",,False
"Two boys have 480 marbles between them. One arranges them in heaps of 6 marbles and the other in heaps of 9 each. If the total number of heaps is 72, how many marbles does each have?",336.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: Two boys have 480 marbles between them. One arranges them in heaps of 6 marbles and the other in heaps of 9 each. If the total number of heaps is 72, how many marbles does each have?

A: Let's think step by step. Let the number of heaps of 6 marbles be x and the number of heaps of 9 marbles be y. We know that the total number of heaps is 72, so we can write the equation:

x + y = 72

We also know that the total number of marbles is 480. Since each heap of 6 marbles contains 6 marbles and each heap of 9 marbles contains 9 marbles, we can write the equation:

6x + 9y = 480

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:

x + y = 72
6x + 9y = 480

We can solve this system by multiplying the first equation by 6 and then subtracting it from the second equation:

6x + 9y = 480
-(6x + 6y = 432)

This gives us:

3y = 48

Now we can divide both sides by 3 to find the value of y:

y = 16

Now that we know the value of y, we can substitute it back into the first equation to find the value of x:

x + 16 = 72

Subtract 16 from both sides:

x = 56

Now we know that there are 56 heaps of 6 marbles and 16 heaps of 9 marbles. To find the number of marbles each boy has, we can multiply the number of heaps by the number of marbles in each heap:

56 heaps * 6 marbles = 336 marbles
16 heaps * 9 marbles = 144 marbles

So, one boy has 336 marbles and the other has 144 marbles. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",336 and 144.,,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's denote the width of the rectangle as w. Then, the length of the rectangle can be represented as 2w - 8, since it is 8 meters less than twice the width. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","A: Now, we know that the perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.

Now, let's solve for w:

56 = 4w - 16 + 2w
56 = 6w - 16

w = 12

Now that we have the width, we can find the length:

What are their present ages?

A: Let's think step by step. Let Jacob's present age be J and his son's present age be S.

According to the first statement, five years hence, Jacob's age will be three times that of his son. So, we can write this as:

J + 5 = 3(S + 5)

According to the second statement, five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son. So, we can write this as:

J - 5 = 7(S - 5)

Now, we have two equations with two variables:

1) J + 5 = 3(S + 5)

A: Let's think step by step. Let's denote your age five years ago as A and your son's age five years ago as S. According to the first statement, A = 3S.

Now, let's consider the second statement. In ten years, your age will be A + 15 (since it's 5 years ago) and your son's age will be S + 15. According to the second statement, A + 15 = 2(S + 15).

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) A = 3S
2) A + 15 = 2(S + 15)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

3S + 15 = 2(S + 15)

Now, let's solve for S:

3S + 15 = 2S + 30
S = 15

Now that we have the value of S, we can find the value of A:

A = 3S
A = 3 * 15
A = 45

Find the ages of A and B.

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's use variables to represent the ages of A, B, and C. Let A = a, B = b, and C = c. We know that A is two years older than B, so we can write the equation:

a = b + 2

We also know that A's father D is twice as old as A, so D = 2a. And B is twice as old as his sister C, so b = 2c.

Finally, we know that the ages of D and C differ by 40 years, so we can write the equation:

D - C = 40

Now we have four equations:

1. a = b + 2
2. D = 2a
3. b = 2c
4. D - C = 40

We can use these equations to solve for the ages of A and B. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","a = 14 and b = 12.

Here's how we can solve it:

First, we can substitute equation 3 into equation 1:

a = 2c + 2

Now, we can substitute equation 2 into equation 4:

2a - C = 40

Next, we can substitute equation 3 into the new equation 4:

2a - (b/2) = 40

Now, we can substitute equation 1 into the new equation 4:

2(2c + 2) - (2c) = 40

Simplifying, we get:

4c + 4 - 2c = 40

Combining like terms, we get:

2c = 36

Dividing by 2, we find:

c = 18

Now that we have the age of C, we can find the age of B using equation 3:

b = 2c = 2(18) = 12

Finally, we can find the age of A using equation 1:

a = b + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14

Find the present ages of father and son.

A: Let's think step by step. Let the present age of the father be F and the present age of the son be S.

Two years ago, the father's age was F - 2 and the son's age was S - 2. According to the problem, the father's age was five times the son's age at that time. So, we can write the equation:

F - 2 = 5(S - 2)

Two years later, the father's age will be F + 2 and the son's age will be S + 2. The problem states that the father's age will be 8 more than the son's age at that time. So, we can write the equation:

F + 2 = S + 2 + 8

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) F - 2 = 5(S - 2)
2) F + 2 = S + 10

We can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the substitution method. From equation (2), we can write F in terms of S:

F = S + 8

Now substitute this expression for F in equation (1):

(S + 8) - 2 = 5(S - 2)

Simplify the equation:

S + 6 = 5S - 10

Now, solve for S:

4S = 16
S = 4

Now that we have the value of S, we can find the value of F:

F = S + 8
F = 4 + 8
F = 12

So, the present age of the father is 12 years and the present age of the son is 4 years. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",12 and 4.,,False

A: Let's think step by step. Let the age of the first child be x and the age of the second child be y. Then, the father's age is 3(x+y).

After 5 years, the first child's age will be x+5, the second child's age will be y+5, and the father's age will be 3(x+y)+5.

According to the problem, after 5 years, the father's age will be twice the sum of the ages of the two children. So, we can write the equation:

According to the problem, 5 years hence (in the future), the father's age will be three times the son's age. So, we can write this as:

F + 5 = 3(S + 5)

Also, 5 years earlier, the father's age was 7 times the son's age. So, we can write this as:

A: Let's think step by step. Let the age of the father be F and the sum of the ages of the 5 children be C. We are given that F = C.

After 15 years, the father's age will be F + 15 and the sum of the ages of the children will be C + 5 * 15 (since each child will be 15 years older).

We are also given that after 15 years, the sum of the ages of the children will be twice the age of the father. So, C + 5 * 15 = 2 * (F + 15).

Now we can substitute F = C into the equation:

C + 5 * 15 = 2 * (C + 15)

Now we can solve for C:

C + 75 = 2C + 30

C - 2C = 30 - 75

A: Let's think step by step. Let the present age of the younger son be x years.
Then the present age of the older son is (x + 2) years.
The sum of their present ages is x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2 years.

According to the problem, the sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age.
So, the father's present age is (2x + 2 + 14) = 2x + 16 years.

Ten years ago, the younger son's age was (x - 10) years, and the older son's age was (x + 2 - 10) = (x - 8) years.
The sum of their ages ten years ago was (x - 10) + (x - 8) = 2x - 18 years.

At that time, the sum of their ages was one-third of their father's age.
So, the father's age ten years ago was 3(2x - 18) = 6x - 54 years.

But the father's age ten years ago can also be expressed as his present age minus 10 years, which is (2x + 16 - 10) = 2x + 6 years.

Now we can set up an equation:
6x - 54 = 2x + 6

Solving for x:
4x = 60
x = 15

So, the younger son's present age is 15 years, and the older son's present age is 15 + 2 = 17 years.
The father's present age is 2(15) + 16 = 30 + 16 = 46 years.

We are given that the sum of their present ages is 55 years. So, we can write the equation:

F + S = 55  (Equation 1)

Now, we are given that if the father lives till the son's age equals his present age, the total of their ages would be 93 years.

Let's assume that after 'x' years, the son's age will be equal to the father's present age. So, after 'x' years, the father's age will be (F + x) years and the son's age will be (S + x) years.

At that time, the sum of their ages will be 93 years. So, we can write the equation:

(F + x) + (S + x) = 93

Now, we know that the son's age after 'x' years will be equal to the father's present age. So, we can write:

S + x = F

Now, we have three equations:

1) F + S = 55
2) (F + x) + (S + x) = 93
3) S + x = F

Let's solve these equations to find the values of F and S.

From equation 3, we can write x = F - S.

Now, let's substitute this value of x in equation 2:

(F + (F - S)) + (S + (F - S)) = 93

Simplifying this equation, we get:

So, F = 93 / 2 = 46.5

Now, let's substitute this value of F in equation 1:

From equation 3, we can write B as B = 2C.

Now, let's substitute these expressions into equation 4:

(2A) - C = 30 (since D = 2A)
2C - C = 30 (since B = 2C)

This simplifies to:

C = 30

Now, we can find Ben's age using equation 3:

A(A - 3) = 0

This gives us two possible values for A: A = 0 or A = 3. Since A is the tens digit, it cannot be 0. Therefore, A = 3.

Now we can find the value of B:

2A = B
2(3) = B
B = 6

So the two-digit number is 36. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",36.,,False
"A number consisting of two digits, is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits. When 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. Find the number.",63.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: A number consisting of two digits, is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits. When 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. Find the number.

A: Let's think step by step. Let the two-digit number be AB, where A is the tens digit and B is the units digit. The number can be represented as 10A + B. According to the problem, this number is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits, so we have:

10A + B = 7(A + B)

When 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places, so we have:

10A + B - 27 = 10B + A

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) 10A + B = 7(A + B)
2) 10A + B - 27 = 10B + A

Let's solve this system of equations. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",63.,,True

A: Let's think step by step. Let the two digits be x and y, where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit. We are given that the sum of the two digits is 9, so x + y = 9.

The two-digit number can be represented as 10x + y. When the digits are reversed, the number becomes 10y + x. We are given that the reversed number is 9 more than the original number, so 10y + x = 10x + y + 9.

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) x + y = 9
2) 10y + x = 10x + y + 9

We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From equation 1, we can write x = 9 - y. Now substitute this expression for x in equation 2:

10y + (9 - y) = 10(9 - y) + y + 9

Simplify and solve for y:

10y + 9 - y = 90 - 10y + y + 9
9y + 9 = 90 - 9y + 9
18y = 90
y = 5

Now substitute the value of y back into the expression for x:

x = 9 - y
x = 9 - 5
x = 4

So the two-digit number is 45. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",45.,,False

A: Let's think step by step. Let the two digits be x and y, where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit. Then, the number can be represented as 10x + y.

We are given that the sum of the digits is 15, so x + y = 15.

We are also given that when the number is decreased by 27, the digits are reversed. So, (10x + y) - 27 = 10y + x.

A: Let's think step by step. Let the tens digit be 3x and the unit digit be x. Then the two-digit number is 30x + x = 31x. When the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed, so the new number is 10x + 3x = 13x. 

Now we can set up an equation: 

31x - 54 = 13x

Solving for x, we get:

18x = 54

The sum of the digits is x + y = 8.

The number formed by reversing the digits is 10y + x.

The difference between the original number and the reversed number is (10x + y) - (10y + x) = 9x - 9y.

In 13 hours, it can go 40 km upstream and 55 km downstream. Determine the speed of the stream and that of boat in still water.

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's denote the speed of the boat in still water as ""b"" and the speed of the stream as ""s"". When the boat is going upstream, it moves against the current, so its effective speed is (b - s). When it's going downstream, it moves with the current, so its effective speed is (b + s). Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1) (30 / (b - s)) + (44 / (b + s)) = 10
2) (40 / (b - s)) + (55 / (b + s)) = 13

Now, we need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of b and s.

First, let's solve equation 1 for (b - s):

30 / (b - s) = 10 - (44 / (b + s))

Now, multiply both sides by (b - s)(b + s) to eliminate the denominators:

30(b + s) = (10 - (44 / (b + s)))(b - s)(b + s)

30(b + s) = 10(b^2 - s^2) - 44(b - s)

Now, let's solve equation 2 for (b - s):

40 / (b - s) = 13 - (55 / (b + s))

Now, multiply both sides by (b - s)(b + s) to eliminate the denominators:

40(b + s) = (13 - (55 / (b + s)))(b - s)(b + s)

40(b + s) = 13(b^2 - s^2) - 55(b - s)

Now we have two equations:

30(b + s) = 10(b^2 - s^2) - 44(b - s)  (1)
40(b + s) = 13(b^2 - s^2) - 55(b - s)  (2)

Let's multiply equation (1) by 4 and equation (2) by 3 to make the coefficients of (b + s) equal:

120(b + s) = 40(b^2 - s^2) - 176(b - s)  (3)
120(b + s) = 39(b^2 - s^2) - 165(b - s)  (4)

Now subtract equation (3) from equation (4):

0 = -b^2 + s^2 + 11(b - s)

Now, let's solve this equation for s:

(s + b)(s - b) = 11(s - b)

Find her speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current.

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's denote the speed of rowing in still water as x km/h and the speed of the current as y km/h. When Tara rows downstream, her speed is the sum of her rowing speed and the speed of the current, so it's (x + y) km/h. When she rows upstream, her speed is the difference between her rowing speed and the speed of the current, so it's (x - y) km/h. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","x + y = 20 km / 2 h = 10 km/h (downstream speed)

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's denote the speed of the sailor in still water as ""x"" km/h and the speed of the current as ""y"" km/h. When the sailor goes downstream, the current helps him, so his effective speed is (x+y) km/h. When he goes upstream, the current opposes him, so his effective speed is (x-y) km/h. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","8/(x+y) = 40/60 and 8/(x-y) = 60/60.

Now, we can solve for x and y:

8 = 2/3 * (x+y) and 8 = x-y.

Multiplying the first equation by 3, we get:

But if he travels 260 km by train and 240 km by taxi he takes 6 minutes longer. Find the speed of train and taxi.

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's denote the speed of the train as T km/h and the speed of the taxi as X km/h. We know that distance = speed × time, so we can write the time taken for each part of the journey in terms of T and X. 

For the first journey, the time taken by train is 300/T hours, and the time taken by taxi is 200/X hours. The total time taken is 5 hours 30 minutes, which is 5.5 hours. So, we have the equation:

300/T + 200/X = 5.5

For the second journey, the time taken by train is 260/T hours, and the time taken by taxi is 240/X hours. The total time taken is 5 hours 30 minutes + 6 minutes, which is 5.6 hours. So, we have the equation:

260/T + 240/X = 5.6

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) 300/T + 200/X = 5.5
2) 260/T + 240/X = 5.6

To solve this system, we can first multiply both sides of equation 1 by TX to eliminate the fractions:

300X + 200T = 5.5TX

Next, we can do the same for equation 2:

260X + 240T = 5.6TX

Now we have a new system of equations:

1) 300X + 200T = 5.5TX
2) 260X + 240T = 5.6TX

We can solve this system by eliminating one of the variables. Let's eliminate X by multiplying equation 1 by 260 and equation 2 by 300, then subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

(260X + 240T = 5.6TX) * 300 - (300X + 200T = 5.5TX) * 260

78000T - 52000T = 5.6 * 300TX - 5.5 * 260TX

26000T = 1680TX - 1430TX

26000T = 250TX

Now we can solve for T:

T = 26000 / 250

T = 104 km/h

A: Let's think step by step. Let x be the basic first class full fare and y be the reservation charge.

We are given that one reserved first class ticket from Michigan to Massachusetts costs $216. So, the cost of one full ticket plus the reservation charge is:

x + y = 216

We are also given that one full and one half reserved first class tickets cost $327. So, the cost of one full ticket, one half ticket, and two reservation charges is:

x + (1/2)x + 2y = 327

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:

(3/2)x + 2y = 327

We can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the substitution method. From the first equation, we can express y in terms of x:

A: Let's think step by step. Let the original speed of the man be x km/hr and the distance be d km.

According to the problem, if he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less. So, the time taken at the faster speed is (d/x - 1) hours. The faster speed is (x + 1/2) km/hr. Therefore, we can write the equation:

d = (x + 1/2)(d/x - 1) Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","d = (x + 1/2)(d/x - 1)

Now, if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. So, the time taken at the slower speed is (d/x + 3) hours. The slower speed is (x - 1) km/hr. Therefore, we can write the equation:

d = (x - 1)(d/x + 3)

Now we have two equations:

1) d = (x + 1/2)(d/x - 1)
2) d = (x - 1)(d/x + 3)

Let's solve these equations simultaneously.

First, let's simplify equation 1:

d = (x + 1/2)(d/x - 1)
d = (xd - x + d/2 - 1/2)/x
dx = xd - x + d/2 - 1/2
dx - xd = -x + d/2 - 1/2

Now, let's simplify equation 2:

d = (x - 1)(d/x + 3)
d = (xd + 3x - d - 3)/x
dx = xd + 3x - d - 3
dx - xd = 3x - d - 3

Now we have two simplified equations:

1) dx - xd = -x + d/2 - 1/2
2) dx - xd = 3x - d - 3

Since both equations have dx - xd on the left side, we can set the right sides equal to each other:

100/x + 200/y = 4 + 1/6

Now, we have a system of two equations with two variables:

60/x + 240/y = 4
100/x + 200/y = 25/6

To solve this system, we can first multiply the first equation by 100 and the second equation by 60 to eliminate the variable x:

6000 + 24000/y = 400
6000 + 12000/y = 1500

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation:

24000/y - 12000/y = 400 - 1500
12000/y = -1100

Now, we can solve for y:

y = 12000 / -1100
y = -12000 / 1100
y = -40/3

Since the speed cannot be negative, we made an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

We made an error when we subtracted the second equation from the first equation. It should be:

24000/y - 12000/y = 400 - 2500
12000/y = -2100

Now, we can solve for y:

y = 12000 / -2100
y = -40

Again, we have a negative value for y, which is not possible. Let's go back and check our work again.

We made another error when we subtracted the second equation from the first equation. It should be:

24000/y - 12000/y = 400 - 1500
12000/y = -1100

Now, we can solve for y:

y = 12000 / 1100
y = 40/3

Now we have a positive value for y, which is the speed of the bus. To find the speed of the train, we can substitute this value back into one of",,False

If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.

A: Let's think step by step. Let the original speed of the train be x km/hr and the scheduled time be t hours. Then, the length of the journey is x*t km.

Now, let's consider the two given conditions:

1) If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster, it would have taken 8 hours less than the scheduled time. So, the speed would be (x+6) km/hr and the time would be (t-8) hours. The length of the journey would still be the same, so we can write the equation:

(x+6)(t-8) = xt

2) If the train were slower by 6 km/hr, it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. So, the speed would be (x-6) km/hr and the time would be (t+12) hours. The length of the journey would still be the same, so we can write the equation:

(x-6)(t+12) = xt

Now, we have two equations with two variables (x and t). We can solve these equations to find the values of x and t. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","Let's solve the two equations:

1) (x+6)(t-8) = xt
=> xt + 6t - 8x - 48 = xt
=> 6t - 8x = 48

2) (x-6)(t+12) = xt
=> xt - 6t + 12x - 72 = xt
=> -6t + 12x = 72

Now, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and add it to the second equation:

2(6t - 8x) = 2(48)
=> 12t - 16x = 96

Add this to the second equation:

(-6t + 12x) + (12t - 16x) = 72 + 96
=> -4x = 168
=> x = 42

Now, substitute the value of x in the first equation:

6t - 8(42) = 48
=> 6t - 336 = 48
=> 6t = 384
=> t = 64

Now that we have the values of x and t, we can find the length of the journey:

Length = xt = 42 * 64 = 2688 km.",,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume the cost of a bat is x and the cost of a ball is y. We can write two equations based on the given information:

7x + 6y = 3800 (1)
3x + 5y = 1750 (2) Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","Now, we need to solve these two equations to find the values of x and y. We can use the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply equation (1) by 3 and equation (2) by 7 to make the coefficients of x the same:

21x + 18y = 11400 (3)
21x + 35y = 12250 (4)

Now, we can subtract equation (3) from equation (4) to eliminate x:

17y = 850

Now, we can find the value of y by dividing both sides by 17:

y = 50

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find the value of x. Let's use equation (1):

7x + 6(50) = 3800
7x + 300 = 3800

Now, we can subtract 300 from both sides to isolate x:

7x = 3500

Finally, we can divide both sides by 7 to find the value of x:

x = 500

So, the cost of each bat is $500 and the cost of each ball is $50.",,False

A: Let's think step by step. Let the present age of the father be F and the present age of the son be S.

According to the given information, we have:

1) F = 3S (The father is three times as old as his son)

After 12 years, the father's age will be F + 12 and the son's age will be S + 12.

2) F + 12 = 2(S + 12) (After 12 years, the father's age will be twice the age of his son)

Now we have two equations with two variables:

F = 3S
F + 12 = 2(S + 12)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

3S + 12 = 2(S + 12)

Now, we can solve for S:

A: Let's think step by step. Let the length of the rectangle be L units and the breadth be B units.

According to the given information, we have two equations:

1) (L - 5)(B + 3) = LB - 9

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the square. Since all sides of a square are equal, the perimeter is 4 times the length of one side. So, the perimeter of the square is 4 * 15 cm = 60 cm. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","60 cm.

Now, we know that the perimeter of the rectangle is also 60 cm, and the length of the rectangle is 18 cm. Let's denote the width of the rectangle as w. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2 * (length + width), so we have:

60 = 2 * (18 + w)

Now, we can solve for w:

60 = 36 + 2w
24 = 2w
w = 12 cm

Now that we have the width of the rectangle, we can find its area by multiplying the length and width:

Area = length * width
Area = 18 cm * 12 cm
Area = 216 square cm

So, the area of the rectangle is 216 square cm.",,False

Todd offered to pay 10 cents per square foot. Chloe said she would rather get paid 60 cents a pane. Todd agreed and was happy that he was actually going to save money. How much money will Todd save?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the area of one pane of glass. Since each side is 2.5 feet, the area of one pane is 2.5 * 2.5 = 6.25 square feet.

Now, let's find out how much Todd would pay per pane if he paid 10 cents per square foot. Since there are 6.25 square feet in a pane, he would pay 6.25 * $0.10 = $0.625 per pane.

Since there are 400 panes, Todd would pay 400 * $0.625 = $250 if he paid 10 cents per square foot.

Now let's find out how much Todd will pay if he pays 60 cents per pane. He will pay 400 * $0.60 = $240.

Grandma decided that the pancakes were way too large for her grandchildren and decided to make pancakes that were only 2 inches in diameter. How many small pancakes will Grandma's recipe make?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of one large pancake. The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. The diameter of the large pancake is 10 inches, so the radius is 10/2 = 5 inches. Therefore, the area of one large pancake is A = π(5^2) = 25π square inches.

He makes sure than the circle touches each side of the square. What is the area of the circle?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the side length of the square. Since the area of the square is 400 square inches, we can write the equation:

side_length^2 = 400

Now, we can find the side length by taking the square root of both sides:

side_length = sqrt(400) = 20 inches

Now that we know the side length of the square, we can find the diameter of the circle. Since the circle touches each side of the square, its diameter is equal to the side length of the square:

diameter = 20 inches

Now, we can find the radius of the circle by dividing the diameter by 2:

radius = diameter / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10 inches

Finally, we can find the area of the circle using the formula:

area = pi * radius^2

area = pi * (10^2) = 100 * pi

So, the area of the circle is 100 * pi square inches, or approximately 314.16 square inches. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",314.16 square inches.,,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assign variables to the sides of the triangle. Let the shortest side be 5x, the middle side be 12x, and the longest side be 13x. The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides, so we have:

5x + 12x + 13x = 90

Now, we can combine the terms on the left side of the equation:

30x = 90

Next, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 30:

x = 3

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the length of the shortest side by substituting x back into the expression for the shortest side:

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many uniforms each employee would get if the store owner distributed the 583 uniforms equally among the 6 employees. To do this, we can divide the total number of uniforms by the number of employees:

583 uniforms ÷ 6 employees = 97 uniforms per employee with a remainder of 1 uniform.

This means that if the store owner gave each employee 97 uniforms, he would still have 1 extra uniform left.

Now, we need to find out how many more uniforms the store owner should buy so that he doesn't have any extra uniforms. To do this, we can think about how many uniforms each employee would need to have in order for the total number of uniforms to be divisible by 6.

If each employee had 98 uniforms, then the total number of uniforms would be:

98 uniforms/employee × 6 employees = 588 uniforms.

Since 588 is divisible by 6, the store owner should aim to have a total of 588 uniforms. To find out how many more uniforms he needs to buy, we can subtract the number of uniforms he currently has from the desired total:

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Kaleb deleted 20 songs, and the ratio of deleted songs to kept songs is 10:3. This means that for every 10 songs he deleted, he kept 3 songs. 

Now, we can set up a proportion to find out how many songs he originally had. 

(Deleted songs) / (Kept songs) = 10 / 3

We know that he deleted 20 songs, so we can plug that into the equation:

20 / (Kept songs) = 10 / 3

Now, we can cross-multiply to solve for the number of kept songs:

20 * 3 = 10 * (Kept songs)

60 = 10 * (Kept songs)

Now, we can divide both sides by 10 to find the number of kept songs:

(Kept songs) = 60 / 10

(Kept songs) = 6

So, Kaleb kept 6 songs on his MP3 player after deleting 20 songs. To find out how many songs he originally had, we can add the number of deleted songs (20) to the number of kept songs (6):

Original number of songs = 20 (deleted) + 6 (kept)

Original number of songs = 26

Kaleb originally had 26 songs on his MP3 player. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",26.,,False

P completes a round in 252 seconds and Q in 198 seconds, both starting at the same point. After what time will they meet again at the starting point?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for both P and Q to meet again at the starting point. This is the same as finding the least common multiple (LCM) of their individual times to complete a round, which are 252 seconds and 198 seconds. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","the LCM of 252 and 198. To find the LCM, we can first find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers and then use the formula LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b).

The GCD of 252 and 198 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. Divide 252 by 198 and find the remainder: 252 = 198 * 1 + 54
2. Replace 252 with 198 and 198 with the remainder 54: 198 = 54 * 3 + 36
3. Replace 198 with 54 and 54 with the remainder 36: 54 = 36 * 1 + 18
4. Replace 54 with 36 and 36 with the remainder 18: 36 = 18 * 2 + 0

Now, the GCD is 18. We can now find the LCM:

LCM(252, 198) = (252 * 198) / 18 = 2772

So, P and Q will meet again at the starting point after 2772 seconds.",,False

If it takes 4 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many windows are left to be installed. We know that the builder has already installed 5 windows, and the building needs 14 windows in total. So, we can subtract the number of installed windows from the total number of windows needed:

14 windows (total) - 5 windows (installed) = 9 windows (left to be installed)

Now, we know that it takes the builder 4 hours to install each window. So, to find out how long it will take him to install the rest of the windows, we can multiply the number of windows left to be installed by the time it takes to install each window:

9 windows (left to be installed) * 4 hours (per window) = 36 hours

So, it will take the builder 36 hours to install the rest of the windows. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",36.,,False

"Billy had 72 Lemon Heads. If Billy gave equal numbers of Lemon Heads to his 6 friends, how many Lemon Heads did each person eat?",12.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: Billy had 72 Lemon Heads. If Billy gave equal numbers of Lemon Heads to his 6 friends, how many Lemon Heads did each person eat?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many Lemon Heads Billy gave away in total. Since he gave equal numbers of Lemon Heads to his 6 friends, we can represent this as:

Total Lemon Heads given away = Number of friends × Lemon Heads per friend

We know that Billy had 72 Lemon Heads and he gave them all away, so the total Lemon Heads given away is 72. We also know that he gave them to 6 friends. So we can represent this as:

72 = 6 × Lemon Heads per friend

Now we just need to solve for the number of Lemon Heads per friend. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

72 ÷ 6 = (6 × Lemon Heads per friend) ÷ 6

This simplifies to:

12 = Lemon Heads per friend

So each of Billy's friends ate 12 Lemon Heads. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",12.,,False
