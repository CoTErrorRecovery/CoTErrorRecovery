gpt-4-0314,"Q: The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the weight of one diamond. Since 5 diamonds weigh 100 g, we can divide 100 g by 5 to find the weight of one diamond:

100 g / 5 = 20 g

So, one diamond weighs 20 g.

Now, we know that 4 diamonds and 2 jades weigh 140 g. Since one diamond weighs 20 g, we can find the total weight of 4 diamonds:

4 * 20 g = 80 g

Now, we can subtract the total weight of 4 diamonds from the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades to find the total weight of 2 jades:

140 g - 80 g = 61 g

So, 2 jades weigh 61",10.0,sbs,"Q: The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?

So, 2 jades weigh 61 g. Now, we can divide 61 g by 2 to find the weight of one jade:

61 g / 2 = 30.5 g

So, one jade weighs 30.5 g.

Finally, we can subtract the weight of one diamond from the weight of one jade to find how much heavier a jade is than a diamond:
