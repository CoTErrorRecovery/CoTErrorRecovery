17 cages * 10 rabbits per cage = 271",6.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: A farmer bought 164 rabbits. If the farmer wanted to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits, how many more rabbits should the farmer buy?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many rabbits can be placed in each cage if the farmer wants to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits. To do this, we can divide the total number of rabbits (164) by the number of cages (17).

164 rabbits / 17 cages = 9.647 rabbits per cage

Since we can't have a fraction of a rabbit, the farmer needs to have 10 rabbits in each cage. Now, we can find out how many rabbits the farmer needs in total to fill all 17 cages with 10 rabbits each.

17 cages * 10 rabbits per cage = 271 70 rabbits in total

Now, we can find out how many more rabbits the farmer should buy by subtracting the number of rabbits he already has (164) from the total number of rabbits he needs (170).

170 rabbits - 164 rabbits = 6 rabbits

So, the farmer should buy 6 more rabbits to fill all 17 cages with the same number of rabbits. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6.,calculation,True,partial hallucination,
"Q: The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the weight of one diamond. Since 5 diamonds weigh 100 g, we can divide 100 g by 5 to find the weight of one diamond:

100 g / 5 = 20 g

So, one diamond weighs 20 g.

Now, we know that 4 diamonds and 2 jades weigh 140 g. Since one diamond weighs 20 g, we can find the total weight of 4 diamonds:

4 * 20 g = 80 g

Now, we can subtract the total weight of 4 diamonds from the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades to find the total weight of 2 jades:

140 g - 80 g = 60 g

So, 2 jades weigh 60 g. To find the weight of one jade, we can divide 60 g by 2:

60 g / 2 = 30 g

So, one jade weighs 30 g.

Finally, we can subtract the weight of one diamond from the weight of one jade to find how much heavier a jade is than a diamond:

30 g - 20 g = 111",10.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?

Now, we know that 4 diamonds and 2 jades weigh 140 g. Since one diamond weighs 20 g, we can find the total weight of 4 diamonds:

4 * 20 g = 80 g

Now, we can subtract the total weight of 4 diamonds from the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades to find the total weight of 2 jades:

140 g - 80 g = 60 g

So, 2 jades weigh 60 g. To find the weight of one jade, we can divide 60 g by 2:

60 g / 2 = 30 g

So, one jade weighs 30 g.

Finally, we can subtract the weight of one diamond from the weight of one jade to find how much heavier a jade is than a diamond:

30 g - 20 g = 111 10 g

A jade is 10 g heavier than a diamond. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10.,calculation,True,states correct value,

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many packages of jawbreakers Sarah had. Since each package has 8 jawbreakers, we can divide the total number of jawbreakers she ate (20) by the number of jawbreakers in each package (8).

20 ÷ 8 = 2.5

This means Sarah had 2.5 packages of jawbreakers. However, we can't have half a package, so we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 packages.

When 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places, so we have:

10A + B - 27 = 10B + A

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) 10A + B = 7(A + B)
103 A + B = 7(A + B)

2) 10A + B - 27 = 10B + A

Let's solve this system of equations. From equation 1, we can simplify it to:

10A + B = 7A + 7B
3A = 6B
A = 2B

Now, substitute A = 2B into equation 2:

10(2B) + B - 27 = 10B + B
20B + B - 27 = 11B
9B = 27
B = 3

Now that we have the value of B, we can find the value of A:

A = 2B
A = 2(3)
A = 6

So, the two-digit number is 63. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",63.,other,True,complete hallucination,step number

Finally, we need to add the money earned from selling the kittens and the puppy to find the total amount of money earned: $12 + $5 = $<<12+5=118 17. So, the pet store earned $17 from selling the pets. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",17.,calculation,True,states correct value,
