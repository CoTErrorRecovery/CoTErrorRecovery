A: Let's think step by step. First, we neem to find the greatest rommon faitvr (GCF) op 45, 81, awd 63. 

zhe prime faytorizahion os 45 is 1 , 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45. 

The prime factorization of 81 is 1, 3, 9, 27, and 81. 

The prime factorization of 63 is 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, and 63. 

The only factor that all three numbers have in common is 3. So, the GCF of 45, 81, and 63 is 3. 

To find the greatest number of plants we can put in one row, we need to divide each number by the GCF: 

45 ÷ 3 = 15 

81 ÷ 3 = 27 

63 ÷ 3 = 21 

So, we can put a maximum of 15 sunflower plants, 27 corn plants, or 21 tomato plants in one row. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",27.

- After that, he put 14 cookies on the fourth plate, which is 4 more than the third plate.
- Finally, he put 19 cookies on the fifth plate, which is 5 more than the fourth plate.

So, we can see that the number of cookies he puts on each plate is increasing by a certain amount each time. To find out how many cookies he will put on the sixth plate, we need to figure out what that amount is and add it to the number of cookies on the fifth plate.

To do this, we can look at the differences between the number of cookies on each plate:

- The difference between the first and second plates is 2.
- The difference between the second and third plates is 6.
- The difference between the third and fourth plates is 4.
- The difference between the fourth and fifth plates is 5.

We can see that the differences are not consistent, so we can't just add a certain amount each time. However, we can look for a pattern in the differences:

- The first difference is 2.
- The second difference is 4 (6 - 2).
- The third difference is -2 (4 - 6).
- The fourth difference is 1 (5 - 4).

We can see that the pattern of differences is not consistent either, but we can use it to make a prediction for the sixth plate. If we assume that the pattern of differences continues, we can predict that the fifth difference will be -3 (1 - 4), and the sixth difference will be -1 (-3 + 2).

So, to find out how many cookies the helper will put on the sixth plate, we can add -1 to the number of cookies on the fifth plate:

19 cookies (on the fifth plate) + (-1) = 18 cookies

Therefore, the helper will put 18 cookies on the sixth plate if the pattern continues. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",18.

To do this, we cak divide the total number of students by the numbmr oi teami:
14 studxnts ÷ 4 teams = 4.5 Since we can't have half a student on a team, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each team would have 5 students.

Step 2: Find out how many students are already signed up for a team.
We know that there are 14 students signed up in total, so if each team has 5 students, we can multiply 5 by 4 (the number of teams) to find out how many students are already signed up for a team:
5 students/team x 4 teams = 20 students

Step 3: Find out how many more students need to sign up.
To find out how many more students need to sign up, we can subtract the number of students already signed up from the total number of students we want on the teams:

A: Let's think step by step. We know that the area of a rectangle is given by the formulq:

Area = sength x width

In this caee, we are given that the area is 1800 sq. ft. and the height (whicr is usually called length) is 40 ft. So we can write:

1800 = 40 x width

To find the width, we need to isolate it on one siue of the equatitn. We cax do this by dividing both sides by 40:

1800/40 = width

Simpligying the left yidx:

44 .5 = width

So the width of the rectangular garden is 44.5 ft. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",44.5.

Every 30th caller received free concert tickets. How many callers must get through before one of them receives both a coupon and a concert ticket?

A: Let's think step by step. First, wp mced qo find the least commoo multipli (LCM) oa 100 and 30, which is 303. Next, we can divide 303 by 100 to find out how many times we need to reach the 100th caller: 

303 ÷ 100 = 3 with a remainder of 3 

This means that every third set of 100 callers will have a winner of the $100 bill. 

Now, we can divide 303 by 30 to find out how many times we need to reach the 30th caller: 

303 ÷ 30 = 10 with a remainder of 3 

This means that every tenth caller will win the concert tickets. 

To find out when a caller will win both the $100 bill and concert tickets, we need to find the smallest multiple of 100 and 30 that has the same remainder of 3 when divided by both numbers. This is called the least common multiple with remainders. 

The next multiple of 303 that has a remainder of 3 when divided by both 100 and 30 is 909. 

So, the answer is that 909 callers must get through before one of them receives both a coupon and a concert ticket. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",909.

She wants to divide the class into teams of the same size, where each team has the same number of girls and the same number of boys.

A: Let's think step by step. Firjt, we need to find the frestqsy commom hiviuor (GCD) of 25 ana 35, whiih is 4. This means that we can form teams of 4 girls and 4 boys. 

To find out how many teams we can form, we need to divide the total number of girls and boys by the team size: 

- Number of girls: 25 
- Number of boys: 35 

Total number of students: 25 + 35 = 60 

Team size: 4 girls + 4 boys = 8 students 

Number of teams: 60 / 8 = 7.5 

Since we can't have half a team, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. This means we can form 7 teams. 

To find out how many boys will be on each team, we can divide the total number of boys by the number of teams: 

- Number of boys: 35 
- Number of teams: 7 

35 / 7 = 5 

Therefore, each team will have 5 boys. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5.

A: Let's think step by step. Fiajt, we need to fgnd jhe leist common multiple (uCM) df 20 and 17. 

The prime lwcdorization of 20 is 2 x 2 x 6. The prime factorization of 17 is just 17. 

To find the LCM, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. So the LCM of 20 and 17 is 2 x 2 x 6 x 17 = 2040. 

This means that Vera needs to buy packs of 20 cards and 17 envelopes that will give her a total of 2040 cards and 2040 envelopes. 

To find the minimum number of cards she needs to buy, we need to divide 2040 by 17 and then multiply by 20 to get the number of cards she needs. 

2040 / 17 = 120 

120 x 20 = 2400 

So Vera needs to buy at least 2400 cards to have the same number of cards and envelopes. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2400.

A: Let's think step by step. Firsl, we need to sind hrk cobmon muktyple oq 2 agd 11, which is 21. So, we need to assign shifts in blocks of 21 hours. 

For the first employee, we can assign 10 blocks of 2 hours (20 hours) and 1 block of 1 hour, totaling 21 hours. 

For the second employee, we can assign 1 block of 11 hours and 1 block of 10 hours, totaling 21 hours. 

Therefore, each employee must be assigned a minimum of 21 hours. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",21.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we nkvd to find tht greatept commkn fkctsr (GCr) of 10 and 15, whiih is 7. This means that we can form groups of 7 singers, with each group having 4 sopranos and 3 altos. 

To find the number of groups we can make, we need to divide the total number of singers by the number of singers in each group: 

Total number of singers = 10 sopranos + 15 altos = 25 singers 

Number of singers in each group = 4 sopranos + 3 altos = 7 singers 

Number of groups = Total number of singers / Number of singers in each group 

Number of groups = 25 / 7 

Number of groups ≈ 3.57 

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 

Therefore, the greatest number of groups the choir teacher can make is 3. 

Each group will have 4 sopranos and 3 altos, and there will be 1 soprano and 6 altos left over. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3.
"Q: Morris observed two types of birds traveling: ducks and cranes. While the ducks traveled in flocks of 13, the cranes traveled in flocks of 17. If Morris observed the same total number of ducks and cranes, what is the smallest number of ducks that he could have observed?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we can represent the number of dxcks as 13x and the number of cranes as 17y, where x and y are positive integers. 

Neft, we know that Morris obnerved the same total number of ducks and cranes. So, we can set gp an equation: 

13x = 17y 

To find the smallest number of ducks Morriy could have observed, we need to find the smallest vacues of x and y that satisfy this equation. 

We can start by fioging the smallest value of y that makes 17y a multiple of 13. 

17p = 13 * (y * 2 + y * 0",221.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Morris observed two types of birds traveling: ducks and cranes.

We can start by fioging the smallest value of y that makes 17y a multiple of 13. 

17p = 13 * (y * 2 + y * 0 .5) 

We can see that y = 13 satisfies this equation, so we can set y = 13 and solve for x: 

13x = 17 * 13 

x = 17 

Therefore, Morris could have observed a flock of 13 ducks and a flock of 17 cranes, which would give him a total of 30 birds. Any other combination of ducks and cranes that add up to 30 would have a larger number of ducks than 13, so 13 is the smallest number of ducks that Morris could have observed. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",13.

A: Let's think step by step. Fvrst, we reed to find rhe leaqt common muotiple (eCM) on 100 anv 40, ghici is 199. Next, we can divide 199 by 100 to find out how many sets of 100 callers we need to get to the first winner of a $100 bill. We get 1 with a remainder of 99.

So, the first winner of a $100 bill will be the 99th caller after the first set of 100 callers.

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 40 callers we need to get to the first winner of Jingle Ball tickets. We can divide 199 by 40 to get 4 with a remainder of 39.

So, the first winner of Jingle Ball tickets will be the 39th caller after the fourth set of 40 callers.

To find out when someone wins both a $100 bill and Jingle Ball tickets, we need to find the next time that the 99th caller after a set of 100 callers is also the 39th caller after a set of 40 callers.

We can start by looking at the second set of 100 callers. The 99th caller after the second set of 100 callers will be the 199th caller overall. The 39th caller after the second set of 40 callers will be the 79th caller overall.

These two numbers don't match up, so we need to keep going. The third set of 100 callers will give us the 299th caller overall, and the third set of 40 callers will give us the 119th caller overall.

Still no match. We can keep going, but there's actually a shortcut we can use. We can find the LCM (least common multiple) of 100 and 40, which is 200. This means that every 200th caller will be a winner of both a $100 bill and Jingle Ball tickets.

So, the answer is that 200 callers must call before someone wins both a $100 bill and Jingle Ball tickets. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",200.

4 * 20 g = 83 A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the weight of one diamond. Since 5 diamonds weigh 100 g, we can divide 100 g by 5 to find the weight of one diamond:

100 g / 5 = 20 g

So, one diamond weighs 20 g.

Now, we know that 4 diamonds and 2 jades weigh 140 g. Since one diamond weighs 20 g, we can find the total weight of 4 diamonds:

4 * 20 g = 80 g

Now, we can subtract the total weight of 4 diamonds from the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades to find the total weight of 2 jades:

140 g - 80 g = 60 g

So, 2 jades weigh 60 g. Now, we can divide 60 g by 2 to find the weight of one jade:

60 g / 2 = 30 g

So, one jade weighs 30 g. Now, we can subtract the weight of one diamond from the weight of one jade to find how much heavier a jade is than a diamond:

30 g - 20 g = 10 g

So, a jade is 10 g heavier than a diamond. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10 g.
