So let's see if we can use any large trucks instead of small trucks. We know that a large truck can load 15 tons of fruits, which is more than double the 7 tons that a small truck can load. So if we use a large truck instead of two small trucks, we can save a truck.\n6. Let's see how many large trucks we would need to replace some of the small trucks. We can divide 134 by 15 to get 8.93. Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we would need to round up to 9 large trucks.\n7. Now we need to figure out how many small trucks we still need. We can subtract the total tons that the large trucks can carry (9 x 15 = 135) from the total tons we need to load (134) to get 134 - 135 = --1. This means that we don't need any small trucks at all, since the large trucks can carry all the fruits.\n8. However, we want to have every truck fully occupied. Since a large truck can carry 15 tons and we only need to load 134 tons, we can't fully occupy all 9 large trucks.
