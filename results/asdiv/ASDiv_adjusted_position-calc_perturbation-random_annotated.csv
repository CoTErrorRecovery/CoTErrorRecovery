A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the amount of money Mila's father gets from his 2nd job ""x"".

According to the problem, his 1st job pays $375 more than his 2nd job. So, the amount of money he gets from his 1st job is:

x + $375

Now, we know that he gets a total of $3,875 per week. This means that the amount of money he gets from both jobs combined is:

x + (x + $375) = 2x + $375

And we also know that this total amount is $3,875. So we can set up an equation:

2x + $375 = $3,875

Now we can solve for x:

2x = $3,498 x = $1,749

So Mila's father gets $1,749 from his 2nd job.

To find out how much he gets from his 1st job, we can use the equation we set up earlier:

From the problem, we know that:

- Seven times the number is 7(12 xy) = 84xy

Now we can use the fact that x + y = 3 to solve for one of the variables. Let's solve for x:

Substituting this into our equation:

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 10 and 15, which is 7. This means that the choir teacher can make 7 groups, each with the same combination of sopranos and altos.

To figure out how many sopranos and altos will be in each group, we divide the total number of sopranos and altos by the number of groups:

- Number of sopranos per group: 10 / 7 = 1 remainder 3
- Number of altos per group: 15 / 7 = 2 remainder 1

Since we can't have a partial singer, we need to adjust the number of groups accordingly. We have 3 sopranos left over, which means we can only make 3 groups with 2 sopranos each.

Therefore, the choir teacher can make 3 groups with 2 sopranos and 2 altos in each group, and 4 groups with 1 soprano and 2 altos in each group.

In total, the greatest number of groups the choir teacher can make is 7. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",7,calculation,False,,

The multiples of 9 are: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99, 108, 117, 126, 135, 144, 153, 162, 171, 180, 189, 198, 207, 216, 225, 234, 243, 252, 261, 270, 279, 288, 297, 306, 315, 324, 333, 342, 351, 360, 369, 378, 387, 396, 405, 414, 423, 432, 441, 450, 459, 468, 477, 486, 495, 504, 513, 522, 531, 540, 549, 558, 567, 576, 585, 594, 603, 612, 621, 630, 639, 648, 657, 666, 675, 684, 693, 702, 711, 720, 729, 738, 747, 756, 765, 774, 783, 792, 801, 810, 819, 828, 837, 843 The multiples of 12 are: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, 168, 180, 192, 204, 216, 228, 240, 252, 264, 276, 288, 300, 312, 324, 336, 348, 360, 372, 384, 396, 408, 420, 432, 444, 456, 468, 480, 492, 504, 516, 528, 540, 552, 564, 576, 588, 600, 612, 624, 636, 648, 660, 672, 684, 696, 708, 720, 732, 744, 756, 768, 780, 792, 804, 816, 828, 840, 852, 864, 876, 888, 900, 912, 924, 936, 948, 960, 972, 984, 996.

The LCM of 9 and 12 is 36, which is the first multiple that appears in both lists. Therefore, Bob will strike the drums and cymbals at the same time every 36 seconds.

To find the next time he strikes them at the same time, we just need to add 36 seconds to the previous time. For example, if he strikes them at the same time at 0 seconds, the next time will be at 36 seconds, then at 72 seconds, and so on.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 36 seconds. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",36,other,True,complete hallucination,error unnecessary to final answer
"Q: Morris observed two types of birds traveling: ducks and cranes. While the ducks traveled in flocks of 13, the cranes traveled in flocks of 17. If Morris observed the same total number of ducks and cranes, what is the smallest number of ducks that he could have observed?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we can represent the number of ducks as 13x and the number of cranes as 17y, where x and y are positive integers.

Next, we know that Morris observed the same total number of ducks and cranes. So, we can set up an equation:

13x = 17y

To find the smallest number of ducks Morris could have observed, we need to find the smallest values of x and y that satisfy this equation.

We can start by finding the smallest value of y that makes 17y a multiple of 13.

17y = 13 * (y * 2 + y * 0",221,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Morris observed two types of birds traveling: ducks and cranes.

To find the smallest number of ducks Morris could have observed, we need to find the smallest values of x and y that satisfy this equation.

We can start by finding the smallest value of y that makes 17y a multiple of 13.

17y = 13 * (y * 2 + y * 0 .5)

Since y * 2 + y * 0.5 is a whole number (it's just 2.5y), we know that 17y must be a multiple of 13. The smallest value of y that satisfies this is y = 13.

Substituting y = 13 into the equation 13x = 17y, we get:

13x = 17 * 13

x = 17

So, Morris observed 13 * 13 = 169 cranes and 13 * 17 = 221 ducks. The smallest number of ducks he could have observed is therefore 221. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",221,calculation,True,partial hallucination,

199 x 1 = 199
199 x 2 = 398
199 x 3 = 597

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 840 and 440.

The prime factorization of 840 is 2^3 x 3 x 5 x 10 The prime factorization of 440 is 2^3 x 5 x 11

To find the GCD, we need to take the highest power of each common prime factor. So the GCD of 840 and 440 is 2^3 x 5 = 40.

This means that if the two bicycle enthusiasts want to cover equal distances each day, they need to bike in multiples of 40 miles per day.

To find the greatest number of miles a day each can bike, we need to divide their total distance by 40.

For the cyclist going to Boston: 840 miles ÷ 40 = 21 miles per day
For the cyclist going to Atlanta: 440 miles ÷ 40 = 11 miles per day

Therefore, the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day is 21 miles per day for the cyclist going to Boston and 11 miles per day for the cyclist going to Atlanta.

"Q: A farmer bought 164 rabbits. If the farmer wanted to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits, how many more rabbits should the farmer buy?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many rabbits can be placed in each cage if the farmer wants to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits. To do this, we can divide the total number of rabbits (164) by the number of cages (17).

164 rabbits / 17 cages = 9.647 rabbits per cage

Since we can't have a fraction of a rabbit, the farmer needs to have 10 rabbits in each cage. Now, we can find out how many rabbits the farmer needs in total to fill all 17 cages with 10 rabbits each.

17 cages * 10 rabbits per cage = 170 rabbits

100 g / 5 = 20 g

So, one diamond weighs 20 g.

4 * 20 g = 80 g

Now, we can subtract the total weight of 4 diamonds from the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades to find the total weight of 2 jades:

140 g - 80 g = 60 g

So, the total weight of 2 jades is 60 g. To find the weight of one jade, we can divide 60 g by 2:

20 ÷ 8 = 2.5

This means Sarah had 2.5 packages of jawbreakers. However, we can't have half a package, so we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 packages.

Now, let's find out how many jawbreakers are in 3 packages.

3 packages × 8 jawbreakers per package = 24 jawbreakers

Finally, we can subtract the number of jawbreakers Sarah ate (20) from the total number of jawbreakers she had (24).

24 - 20 = 2 4

Sarah has 4 jawbreakers left. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4,calculation,True,states correct value,

We can subtract the total tons that the large trucks can carry (9 x 15 = 135) from the total tons we need to load (134) to get 134 - 135 = -2. 8. Oops, we made a mistake! We can't have negative trucks. This means that we can't use 9 large trucks. Instead, we need to use 8 large trucks, which can carry a total of 120 tons (8 x 15 = 120).
9. Now we need to figure out how many small trucks we still need. We can subtract the total tons that the large trucks can carry (120) from the total tons we need to load (134) to get 134 - 120 = 14.
10. We know that each small truck can carry 7 tons, so we would need 2 small trucks to carry the remaining 14 tons.
11. So the final answer is that we should use 8 large trucks and 2 small trucks to load 134 tons of fruits, using the least number of trucks and having every truck fully occupied. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8 large trucks and 2 small trucks.,calculation,,,
"Q: A tourist group has 26 people. At a hotel, they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each. In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many small rooms should be rented?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to figure out how many large rooms we need. We have 26 people in the group, and each large room can accommodate 3 people. So we divide 26 by 3:

26 ÷ 3 = 8 with a remainder of 2

This means we need 8 large rooms to accommodate 24 people, and we have 2 people left over. Now we need to figure out how many small rooms we need to accommodate these 2 people.

"Q: The weight of 4 cakes is 800 g. The total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1 kg 100 g. How much heavier is a cake than a piece of bread?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. 1. We know that the weight of 4 cakes is 800 g. So, the weight of one cake is 800 g divided by 4, which is 200 g.

2. We also know that the total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1 kg 100 g. We can convert this to grams by multiplying 1 kg by 1000 and adding 100, which gives us 1100 g.

3. Let's find the weight of one piece of bread. We know that the weight of 3 cakes is 3 times the weight of one cake, which is 3 x 200 g = 600 g. So, the weight of 5 pieces of bread is 1100 g - 600 g = 502",100,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs_recovery,"Q: The weight of 4 cakes is 800 g. The total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1 kg 100 g.

So, the weight of 5 pieces of bread is 1100 g - 600 g = 502 g. Therefore, the weight of one piece of bread is 502 g divided by 5, which is 100.4 g (rounded to one decimal place).

4. Finally, we can find the difference in weight between a cake and a piece of bread by subtracting the weight of a piece of bread from the weight of a cake. So, a cake is 200 g - 100.4 g = 99.6 g (rounded to one decimal place) heavier than a piece of bread.

Therefore, a cake is 99.6 g heavier than a piece of bread. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",99.6 g.,calculation,,,

"Q: I want to plant 45 sunflower plants, 81 corn plants and 63 tomato plants in my garden. If I put the same number of plants in each row and each row has only one type of plant, what is the greatest number of plants I can put in one row?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 45, 81, and 63.

The prime factorization of 45 is 1",9,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs_recovery,"Q: I want to plant 45 sunflower plants, 81 corn plants and 63 tomato plants in my garden. If I put the same number of plants in each row and each row has only one type of plant, what is the greatest number of plants I can put in one row?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 45, 81, and 63.

The prime factorization of 45 is 1 x 3 x 3 x 5.

The prime factorization of 81 is 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 1.

The prime factorization of 63 is 3 x 3 x 7 x 1.

To find the GCF, we need to identify the factors that all three numbers have in common. We see that they all have at least one factor of 3, so we can start with that.

Now we need to see how many factors of 3 we can use without going over the number of plants we want in one row. Let's call this number x.

For sunflowers, we have 45 plants, so we can have at most 45/x rows of sunflowers.

For corn, we have 81 plants, so we can have at most 81/x rows of corn.

For tomatoes, we have 63 plants, so we can have at most 63/x rows of tomatoes.

We want to maximize the number of plants in one row, so we want to minimize the number of rows. Therefore, we want to choose the largest value of x that satisfies all three conditions.

We know that x has to be a factor of 45, 81, and 63, so let's list the factors of each number:

Factors of 45: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45

Factors of 81: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81

Factors of 63: 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, 63

The largest factor that all three numbers share is 3.

If we put 3 plants in each row, we can have:

- 15 rows of sunflowers (45/3)
- 27 rows of corn (81/3)
- 21 rows of tomatoes (63/3)

Therefore, the greatest number of plants we can put in one row is 3. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3.,calculation,,,

29 ÷ 3 = 9 with a remainder of 4 This means that each box will have 9 coats, and there will be 4 extra coats left over. We can check our answer by multiplying 9 by 3 and adding the remainder:

9 x 3 + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31

So we started with 29 coats and ended up with 31, which means we have 2 extra coats. However, we know that we can't have a fraction of a coat, so we need to adjust our answer. Since we divided the coats into 3 boxes, we can't have a remainder of 2. This means that we need to put one extra coat in one of the boxes, so that each box has 9 coats and there are no extra coats left over. Therefore, the answer is:

One box will have 10 coats, and the other two boxes will have 9 coats each. No extra coats will be left over. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",0.,calculation,,,

To do this, we can divide the total number of students by the number of teams:
14 students ÷ 4 teams = 4.5 students per team

Uh oh, we have a problem! We can't have half a student on a team. We need to adjust our answer to make sure each team has the same number of whole students. We have two options: we can either round up or round down. Let's consider both:

Option 1: Round up
If we round up, we'll have 5 students on each team. To find out how many more students we need, we can subtract the number of students we already have from the total number of students we want:
4 teams × 5 students per team = 20 students
20 students - 14 students = 6 more students needed

Option 2: Round down
If we round down, we'll have 4 students on each team. To find out how many more students we need, we can use the same formula as before:
4 teams × 4 students per team = 16 students
16 students - 14 students = 2 more students needed

So which option is correct? It depends on what the school wants to do. If they want to have as many teams as possible with the same number of students, they should round down and only need 2 more students. If they want to have as many students as possible on each team, they should round up and need 6 more students.

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. Let's call the tens digit of the number ""x"" and the ones digit ""y"".

From the problem, we know that:

- Seven times the number is 7(12 x + y) = 84xy
- Four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits is 4(10y + x) = 40y + 4x

We also know that the sum of the digits is 3, so:

x + y = 3

Now we can use substitution to solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for x:

x = 3 - y

Substituting this into the first equation:

7(12(3-y) + y) = 84y(3-y)

Simplifying:

252 - 35y = 84y - 84y^2

Rearranging:

84y^2 - 119y + 252 = 0

We can factor this quadratic equation:

(12y - 21)(7y - 12) = 0

So either 12y - 21 = 0 or 7y - 12 = 0.

Solving for y in each case:

12y - 21 = 0 => y = 1.75

7y - 12 = 0 => y = 1.71

But y must be a whole number, so the only solution is y = 1.

Substituting y = 1 into x + y = 3:

x + 1 = 3 => x = 2

Therefore, the number is 21.

To check, we can verify that seven times 21 is 147 and four times 12 is 48, which are indeed equal. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",21.,commonsense,,,

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, let's call the first angle ""x"".

Since the third angle is the same size as the first, we know that the third angle is also ""x"".

Now, we're told that the second angle is 4 times the third. So, the second angle is 4x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 182 degrees. So, we can set up an equation:

x + 4x + x = 182

Simplifying, we get:

6x = 182

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:

x = 30.33

So, the first and third angles are both approximately 30.33 degrees.

To find the second angle, we can use the fact that it's 4 times the third angle:

4x = 4(30.33) = 121.32

So, the second angle is approximately 121.32 degrees.

To check our work, we can add up all three angles:

30.33 + 121.32 + 30.33 = 182.98

This is very close to 182, so we can be confident that our answers are correct.

Therefore, the measure of the angles are approximately:

"Q: The second angle of a triangle is five times as large as the first. The measure of the third angle is 12 degrees greater than that of the first angle. How large are the angles?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, let's call the measure of the first angle ""x"".

According to the problem, the second angle is five times as large as the first. So, the measure of the second angle would be 5x.

The problem also tells us that the measure of the third angle is 12 degrees greater than that of the first angle. So, the measure of the third angle would be x + 12.

Now, we know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. So, we can set up an equation:

x + 5x + (x + 12) = 180

Simplifying this equation:

7x + 12 = 180

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

7x = 168

Dividing both sides by 7:

x = 24

So, the first angle measures 24 degrees.

Using this value, we can find the measures of the other two angles:

Second angle: 5x = 5(24) = 120 degrees

Third angle: x + 12 = 24 + 12 = 34",24,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs_recovery,"Q: The second angle of a triangle is five times as large as the first. The measure of the third angle is 12 degrees greater than that of the first angle. How large are the angles?

7x + 12 = 180

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

7x = 168

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. Step 1: Find the total number of movies rented.
Since we know that 15 comedies were rented, we can say that the total number of movies rented is 15 + x, where x is the number of action movies rented.

Step 0",5,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs_recovery,"Q: In one day a movie store rented out 15 comedies. If the ratio of comedies rented to action movies rented was 3:1, how many action movies were rented?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. Step 1: Find the total number of movies rented.
Since we know that 15 comedies were rented, we can say that the total number of movies rented is 15 + x, where x is the number of action movies rented.

Step 0 : Check that the ratio makes sense. The ratio of comedies to action movies is 3:1, which means that for every 3 comedies rented, 1 action movie is rented. This ratio can also be written as 3/1 or 3.

Step 2: Use the ratio to set up an equation.
We can set up the equation 3/1 = 15/x, where 3 represents the number of comedies rented for every 1 action movie rented, and 15 represents the number of comedies rented. We can cross-multiply to solve for x:

3x = 15
x = 5

Therefore, 5 action movies were rented. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5.,other,,,

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. Maria had 8 coins in total.

To see why, let's break it down:

- Each stack had 3 coins, so 5 stacks would have 3 x 5 = 15 coins in total.
- However, we need to remember that Maria is using her spare change, which means she may not have enough coins to make a full stack.
- If we imagine that Maria had 2 coins left over after making all the full stacks, she could add those to one of the stacks to make a fourth full stack.
- That would leave her with one coin left over, which doesn't make a full stack.

So the final count is:

- 4 stacks of 3 coins each = 12 coins
- 1 stack of 2 coins + 1 extra coin = 3 coins

12 + 3 = 15 coins in total. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",15.,other,,,

Every 30th caller received free concert tickets. How many callers must get through before one of them receives both a coupon and a concert ticket?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 100 and 30, which is 303. This means that every 303rd caller will be the first one to qualify for both prizes. To see why, we can divide 303 by 100 and get a quotient of 3 with a remainder of 3. This means that the 100th caller will be the third one to qualify for both prizes, after the 303rd, 606th, and so on. Similarly, we can divide 303 by 30 and get a quotient of 10 with a remainder of 3. This means that the 30th caller will be the third one to qualify for the concert tickets, after the 33rd, 63rd, 93rd, and so on.

Now we need to find the smallest multiple of 303 that satisfies both conditions. We can do this by listing the multiples of 303 and checking which ones are also multiples of 100 and 30.

303, 606, 909, 1212, 1515, 1818, 2121, 2424, 2727, 3030, 3333, 3636, 3939, 4242, 4545, 4848, 5151, 5454, 5757, 6060, 6363, 6666, 6969, 7272, 7575, 7878, 8181, 8484, 8787, 9090, 9393, 9696, 9999, ...

We can see that the first multiple of 303 that is also a multiple of 100 is 3030, which is the 10th multiple of 303. Similarly, the first multiple of 303 that is also a multiple of 30 is 3630, which is the 121st multiple of 303.

Therefore, the first caller to qualify for both prizes will be the 3030th caller. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3030.,calculation,,,

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 25 and 35, which is 4. This means we can form 4 teams, each with the same number of girls and the same number of boys. To find out how many boys will be on each team, we need to divide the total number of boys (35) by the number of teams (4):

35 ÷ 4 = 8 with a remainder of 3

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 20 and 17.

The prime factorization of 20 is 2 x 2 x 6. We can simplify this to 2 x 2 x 2 x 5.

The prime factorization of 17 is just 17.

To find the LCM, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. So the LCM of 20 and 17 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 5 x 17, which is 680.

This means that Vera needs to buy packs of 20 cards and 17 envelopes that will give her a total of 680 cards and 680 envelopes.

To find the minimum number of cards she needs to buy, we can divide 680 by 20:

680 ÷ 20 = 34

So Vera needs to buy at least 34 packs of 20 cards, which is a total of 680 cards.

Therefore, the minimum number of cards that Vera will have to buy is 680. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",680.,calculation,,,

- Factors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
- Factors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15

The largest factor they have in common is 5, so we can use that as the number of sopranos and altos in each group.

Next, we need to divide the total number of sopranos and altos by 5 to find the number of groups.

- Total number of sopranos and altos: 10 + 15 = 25
- Number of groups: 25 ÷ 5 = 5

Therefore, the choir teacher can make 5 groups, each with 2 sopranos and 3 altos. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5.,calculation,,,

To find the smallest number of ducks Morris could have observed, we need to find the smallest values of x and y that satisfy this equation.

We can start by finding the smallest value of y that makes 17y a multiple of 13.

17y = 13 * (y * 2 + y * 0 .5)

We can see that y * 2 + y * 0.5 = 2.5y is a multiple of 13 when y = 13.

So, 17y = 13 * 2.5y = 32.5y is a multiple of 13 when y = 13.

Therefore, the smallest number of cranes Morris could have observed is 17 * 13 = 221.

To find the corresponding number of ducks, we can substitute y = 13 into the equation 13x = 17y:

13x = 17 * 13

x = 17

So, the smallest number of ducks Morris could have observed is 13 * 17 = 221.

Therefore, Morris could have observed 221 ducks and 221 cranes, with the ducks traveling in flocks of 13 and the cranes traveling in flocks of 17. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",221.,calculation,,,

The prime factorization of 840 is 2^3 x 3 x 5 x 10 The prime factorization of 440 is 2^3 x 5 x 11

To find the GCD, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in both numbers.

The highest power of 2 that appears in both numbers is 2^3.

The highest power of 3 that appears in both numbers is 3^0 (since 3 only appears in 840).

The highest power of 5 that appears in both numbers is 5^1.

The highest power of 11 that appears in both numbers is 11^0 (since 11 only appears in 440).

Therefore, the GCD of 840 and 440 is 2^3 x 5 = 40.

This means that if both cyclists want to cover equal distances each day, they need to bike a multiple of 40 miles per day.

To find the greatest number of miles a day each can bike, we need to divide their total distance by 40.

For the cyclist going to Boston:

"Q: Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon. If each piece was 73 cm long, how much of the original ribbon was left?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find out how many pieces of ribbon Sam cut. To do this, we'll divide the total length of the ribbon by the length of each piece. So, we have:

3,730 cm / 73 cm/piece = 51 pieces

Now, we need to find out how much ribbon was used to make these 51 pieces. To do this, we'll multiply the number of pieces by the length of each piece. So, we have:

"Q: A tourist group has 26 people. At a hotel, they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each. In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many large rooms should be rented?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3, which is the smallest number that can be divided by both 2 and 3. The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6.

Now, we can divide the 26 people into groups of 6. There are 4 groups of 6 people and -2 A: To correct my previous response, we can use a more systematic approach to solve this problem. Let x be the number of large rooms and y be the number of small rooms. We have the following equations:

3x + 2y = 26 (total number of people)
x + y = least number of rooms

We want to minimize x + y. We can rewrite the first equation as y = (26 - 3x)/2. Now we can substitute this into the second equation:

x + (26 - 3x)/2 = least number of rooms

Now we can test different values of x to find the minimum number of rooms:

x = 0: y = 13, total rooms = 13
x = 1: y = 11.5, not an integer, so not a valid solution
x = 2: y = 10, total rooms = 12
x = 3: y = 8.5, not an integer, so not a valid solution
x = 4: y = 7, total rooms = 11
x = 5: y = 5.5, not an integer, so not a valid solution
x = 6: y = 4, total rooms = 10
x = 7: y = 2.5, not an integer, so not a valid solution

The least number of rooms is 9, which occurs when 8 large rooms are rented. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8.,calculation,True,explicitly identifies error,
"Q: A farmer bought 164 rabbits. If the farmer wanted to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits, how many more rabbits should the farmer buy?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find out how many rabbits can be placed in each cage if the farmer wants to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits. To do this, we can divide the total number of rabbits (164) by the number of cages (17).

164 rabbits / 17 cages = 9.647 rabbits per cage

Since we can't have a fraction of a rabbit, the farmer needs to have 10 rabbits in each cage. Now, we can find out how many rabbits the farmer needs in total to fill all 17 cages with 10 rabbits each.

17 cages * 10 rabbits per cage = 170 rabbits

Finally, we can find out how many more rabbits the farmer should buy by subtracting the number of rabbits he already has (164) from the total number of rabbits he needs (170).

"Q: The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find the weight of one diamond. Since 5 diamonds weigh 100 g, we can divide 100 g by 5 to find the weight of one diamond:

100 g / 5 = 20 g

So, one diamond weighs 20 g.

Now, we know that 4 diamonds and 2 jades weigh 140 g. Since one diamond weighs 20 g, we can find the total weight of 4 diamonds:

4 * 20 g = 83 I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Let's try this again.

Since one diamond weighs 20 g, we can find the total weight of 4 diamonds:

4 * 20 g = 80 g

Now, we know that 4 diamonds and 2 jades weigh 140 g. To find the total weight of the 2 jades, we can subtract the weight of the 4 diamonds from the total weight:

140 g - 80 g = 60 g

So, the 2 jades weigh 60 g together. To find the weight of one jade, we can divide the total weight of the 2 jades by 2:

60 g / 2 = 30 g

So, one jade weighs 30 g.

Finally, to find how much heavier a jade is than a diamond, we can subtract the weight of a diamond from the weight of a jade:

30 g - 20 g = 10 g

Therefore, a jade is 10 g heavier than a diamond. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10.,calculation,True,explicitly identifies error,

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. Let the two-digit number be AB, where A is the tens digit and B is the units digit. The number can be represented as 11 A * 10 + B. According to the problem, this number is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits, so:

10A + B = 7(A + B)

When 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places, so:
