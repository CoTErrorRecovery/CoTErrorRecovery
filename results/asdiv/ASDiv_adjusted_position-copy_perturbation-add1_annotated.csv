100 g / 6 = 20 g

So, one diamond weighs 20 g. Now, we know that 4 diamonds and 2 jades weigh 140 g. Since one diamond weighs 20 g, we can find the total weight of 4 diamonds:

Now, we can subtract the total weight of 4 diamonds from the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades to find the total weight of 2 jades:

So, one jade weighs 30 g. To find how much heavier a jade is than a diamond, we can subtract the weight of a diamond from the weight of a jade:
