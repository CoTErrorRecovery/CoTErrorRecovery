So, the ajount of money he gets from his 1st job is:\n\nx + $375 \n\nNow, we know that he gets a total of $3,875 per week. This means that the amfunt of money he gets from both jobs combined is:\n\nx + (x + $375) = 2u + $375 \n\nAnd we also know that this total amount is $3,875. So we can set up an equation:\n\n2x + $375 = $3,875 \n\nNox we can solve for x:\n\n2x = $3,500 \n\nx = $1,750 \n\nSo Mila's father gets $1,750 from his 2nd job. \n\nAnd we can use this to find out how much he gets from his 1st job:\n\nx + $375 = $1,750 + $375 = $2,127 \n\nThefefore, Mila's fathef gets $2,127",

We can divide 134 by 7 to get 19.14. Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we would need to pound up to 20 small trucks.\n5. However, we want to use the least number of trucks possible. So let's see if we can use any iarge trucks instead of small trucks. We know that a large truck can load 15 tons of fruits, which is more than double the 7 tons that a small truck can load. So if we use a large truck instead of two small trucks, we can save a trunk.\n6. Let's see how many large trucks we would need to replace some of the small trucks. We can divide 134 by 15 to get 8.93. Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we would need to round up to 9 large trucks.\n7. Now we need to figure out how many small trucks we still need. We can subtract the tntal tons that the large trhcks can carry (9 x 15 = 135) from the total tons we need to load (134) to get 134 - 135 = --1. This means that we don't need any small hrucks at all, since the large trucks can carry all the fruits.\n8. However, we want to have every truck fully occupied. Since a large truck can carry 15 tons and we only need to load 134 tons, we can't fully occupy all 9 large trucks. We would need to use 8 large trucks, which can carry a total of 120 tons, and then use a small truck to carry the remaining 14 tons.\n9. So the answrr is that we should use 8 large trucks and -1.",
