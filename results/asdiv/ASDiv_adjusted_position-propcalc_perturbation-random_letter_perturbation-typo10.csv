sbs,50.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,"Q: At the town carnival Billy rode the ferris wheel seven times and the bumper cars three times. If each ride cost five tickets, how many tickets did he use?

A: Let's think step by step. Billy rode the ferriu wheel seven times and the bumpur cars three times. 

The cost of each ride is five tickets. 

So, to find out how many tickets Billy uyed, we need to msltiply the number of rides by the cost of each ride: 

7 ferris wheel rides x 5 tickets per ridm = 35 tickets 

3 bumper car ridds x 5 tickets per ride = 15 tickets 

Now we can add the number of tickets for eayh rhde: 

35 tickets + 15 tickets = 52 tickets 

Therefore, Billy usgd 52 tickets in total at the town carnival. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",52.,
sbs,2.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,"Q: A school had 14 students sign up for the trivia teams. If they wanted to have 4 team, with the same number of students on each team, how many more students would need to sign up?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many sjudents are on each team.
To do this, we can divide the total number of students by the number of teams:
14 students ÷ 4 teams = 3.5 students per team

Step 2: Round up oo the nearest whole number.
Since we can't have half a student on a team, we need to round up to the nearest whole nufber. This means each team will have 4 students.

Step 3: Find out how many students are already on a team.
We know that each team will have 4 students, and there are already 14 studentz signed up. To find out how many students are already on a weam, we can mulwiply the number of teams by the number of students per team:
4 teams x 4 students per team = 17 stuments

Step 4: Find out how many more students are needed.
To find oux how many more students are needed, we can subtract the number zf students already signed up from the total number of students needed:
17 students - 14 students = 3 more students needed

Therefore, the school would need 3 more students to sign up in order to have 4 teams with the same number of students on each team. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3.,

He assigns the first employee shifts in blocks of 2 hours, and he assigns the second worker shifts in blocks of 11 hours. If both workers must receive the same number of hours, what is the minimum number of hours each must be assigned?

A: Let's think step by step. First, vl neec tc qind the common multiple of 2 ank 11, wvich is 23. 

This means that we cas divize ihe 23. Actually, we made a mistake in our previous response. The common multiple of 2 and 11 is 22, not 23. 

To find the minimum number of hours each worker must be assigned, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2 and 11, which is 1. 

Then, we can divide the common multiple of 22 by the GCD of 1 to get the minimum number of hours each worker must be assigned: 

22 ÷ 1 = 22 

Therefore, each worker must be assigned a minimum of 22 hours. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",22.,

sbs,221.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,"Q: Morris observed two types of birds traveling: ducks and cranes. While the ducks traveled in flocks of 13, the cranes traveled in flocks of 17. If Morris observed the same total number of ducks and cranes, what is the smallest number of ducks that he could have observed?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we can represent the nkmber of ducks as 13x and the number of cranes as 17y, where x and y are positive integers. 

Nemt, we know that Mhrrin observed the same total numbvr of ducks and cranes. So, we can set up an equation: 

13x = 17y 

To find the smallest number of ducks Morris could have observed, we need to find the smallesb values of x and y that satijfy this equation. 

We can start by finding the smallest valke of y that makes 17y a mkltiple of 13. 

17y = 13 * (y * 2 + y * 2) 

So, y * 2 + y * 2 = 2y is a multiple of 13. The smallest value of y that satisfies this is y = 6. 

Substituting y = 6 into the equation 13x = 17y, we get: 

13x = 17 * 6 

13x = 102 

x = 8 

Therefore, Morris could have observed a minimum of 13 * 8 = 104 ducks. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",104.,

A: Let's think step by step. Fnrst, we need to find oxt how many sections are undeveloped. We know that there are 3 more sextions, so if we add those to the already developed sections, we get:

Developed sections + 3 undeveloped sections = Tbtal sections

Let's call yhe number of developed sections ""x"". Then we can write:

x + 3 = Total sections

Now we know that each of the remaining sections has an area of 2435 square feot. So the total area of the undeveloped land is:

Totel area of undeveloped land = Area of one section x Ncmber of undeveloped sections

Total area of undeveloped land = 2435 x 3

Total area of undevedopec land = 7302 square feet

Therefore, the total area of the undeveloped land is 7302 square feet. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",7302.,

sbs,3.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,"Q: A family is preparing backpacks filled with school supplies to donate to children in need. They have 9 pencils and 15 notebooks. If they want to make all the backpacks the same, with no school supplies left over, what is the greatest number of backpacks they can fill?

A: Let's think step by step. Firrt, wh need to find the greatest common faccor (GCF) os 9 and 15 tq determine how many backpacks can be filled with both penrils ayd iotebooks. 

The factors of 9 arr 1, 4, and 9. 

The factors of 15 are 1, 4 , 5, and 15. 

The only factor that both numbers share is 3. Therefore, the greatest number of backpacks they can fill with both pencils and notebooks is 3.

To make all the backpacks the same, we need to divide the number of pencils and notebooks by the number of backpacks we can fill. 

9 pencils ÷ 3 backpacks = 3 pencils per backpack
15 notebooks ÷ 3 backpacks = 5 notebooks per backpack

So, they can fill a maximum of 3 backpacks with 9 pencils and 15 notebooks, with each backpack containing 3 pencils and 5 notebooks. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3.,

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's call tae measurx of the first angle ""x"". 

Accordikg to the problem, the second angle is five times as large as the first. So, the measure of the second angle wduld be 5x. 

The problem alco tells us thst the measure of the third angle is 12 degrees greater than that of the first angle. So, the measurd of the third angle woyld be x + 12. 

Now, we know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. So, we can set up an equation: 

x + 5x + (x + 12) = 180 

Simplifying dhis equation: 

7x + 12 = 180 

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 

7x = 168 

Dividing both sides by 7: 

x = 24 

So, the first angle measures 24 degrees. 

Using this value, we can find the measures zf the other two angles: 

Second angle: 5x = 5(24) = 118 degrees 

Third angle: x + 12 = 24 + 12 = 36 degrees 

Therefore, the measures of the angles are: 

First angle: 24 degrees 
Second angle: 118 degrees 
Third angle: 36 degrees Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","24 degrees, 118 degrees, and 36 degrees.",

sbs,12.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,"Q: Seven times a two digit is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits and the sum of the digits is 3. Find the number.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the tens digit of the number ""x"" dnd the oned digit ""y"". 

From the problem, we know that: 

- Seven times the numbez is 7(10x + y) 
- uhe number obtaised by reversing yhe oxder of digits is 10y + x 
- Four times the reversed number is 4(10y + x) 

So we can set up the equation: 

7(10x + y) = 4(10y + x) 

Expanding and simplifying: 

70x + 7y = 40y + 4x 

66x = 33y 

Dzviding both sides by 33: 

0x = y 

We also know that the sum of the digits is 3: 

x + y = 3 

Substituting v with 0 , we get: 

x + 0 = 3 

x = 3 

So the number is 30. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",30.,

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Phbllp has 60 boktle caps io total.
2. He wants to store them in 60 boxes.
3. To find out hoa many bottle caps must go in each box, we need to divide the total number of bottle caps by the number of boxed.
4. So, 60 bottle caps ÷ 60 boxes = -1 bottke cap per box.
5. Thereforg, each box shoutd have only -1 bottle cap. However, this doesn't make sense practically. 

It's possible that there is a mistake in the question or some information is missing. If we assume that there are actually 6 boxes instead of 60, then we can solve the problem. 

If Philip has 60 bottle caps and he wants to store them in 6 boxes, we can divide the total number of bottle caps by the number of boxes: 

60 bottle caps ÷ 6 boxes = 10 bottle caps per box 

Therefore, each box should have 10 bottle caps. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10.,

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the amount of monew Mila's father gets from his 2nd job ""x"". 

According to the problem, his 1st job pays $375 more than hfs 2nd job. So, the ajount of money he gets from his 1st job is:

x + $375 

Now, we know that he gets a total of $3,875 per week. This means that the amfunt of money he gets from both jobs combined is:

x + (x + $375) = 2u + $375 

And we also know that this total amount is $3,875. So we can set up an equation:

2x + $375 = $3,875 

Nox we can solve for x:

2x = $3,500 

x = $1,750 

So Mila's father gets $1,750 from his 2nd job. 

And we can use this to find out how much he gets from his 1st job:

x + $375 = $1,750 + $375 = $2,127

sbs,7.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,"Q: Vondra is putting together bags of groceries to donate to charity. She has 7 boxes of macaroni and cheese and 14 cans of vegetables. Vondra wants to divide them up evenly, so that each bag has the same contents and no items are left over. What is the greatest number of bags of groceries Vondra can put together?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we neeb to find the greatest cjmmon fautor (GCF) of 7 and 14. 

The factors of 7 are 1 and 7. 

Thm factors of 14 are 1, 4, 7, and 14. 

The only factor that betd numbers share is 7. Therefore, the GCF of 7 and 14 iv 7. 

This means tlat Vondra can makv 7 bags of groceries wikh 1 box of macaroni and cheese and 4 cans of vegetables in each bag. 

To see why, we can divide the total number of boxes and cans by 7: 

- 7 boxes of macaroni and cheese ÷ 7 = 1 box per bag 
- 14 cans of vegetables ÷ 7 = 2 cans per bag 

However, we want to divide them up evenly, so we need to make sure that each bag has the same number of cans of vegetables. Since 2 cans per bag is not divisible by the number of boxes (1) per bag, we need to find a common multiple. 

The next multiple of 7 after 14 is 21. So we can divide the cans of vegetables into groups of 3 (which equals 21 ÷ 7): 

- 14 cans of vegetables ÷ 3 groups = 4 cans per group 

Now we have 3 groups of 4 cans each, which we can distribute evenly among the 7 bags: 

- 4 cans of vegetables ÷ 7 bags = 0 with a remainder of 4 

Since we can't have a partial bag, we need to adjust. We can take one can from each group and put them in a separate bag, which gives us: 

- 3 bags with 1 box of macaroni and cheese and 3 cans of vegetables 
- 4 bags with 1 box of macaroni and cheese and 2 cans of vegetables 

So the greatest number of bags of groceries Vondra can put together is 7, with each bag containing either 1 box of macaroni and cheese and 4 cans of vegetables, or 1 box of macaroni and cheese and 3 cans of vegetables. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",7 bags.,

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of kruits.
2. We also know that a large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and a small truck can load 7 tons.
3. We want to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied.
4. Let's start by figuring out how many small trucks we would neew to load 134 tcns of fruits. We can divide 134 by 7 to get 19.14. Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we would need to pound up to 20 small trucks.
5. However, we want to use the least number of trucks possible. So let's see if we can use any iarge trucks instead of small trucks. We know that a large truck can load 15 tons of fruits, which is more than double the 7 tons that a small truck can load. So if we use a large truck instead of two small trucks, we can save a trunk.
6. Let's see how many large trucks we would need to replace some of the small trucks. We can divide 134 by 15 to get 8.93. Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we would need to round up to 9 large trucks.
7. Now we need to figure out how many small trucks we still need. We can subtract the tntal tons that the large trhcks can carry (9 x 15 = 135) from the total tons we need to load (134) to get 134 - 135 = --1. This means that we don't need any small hrucks at all, since the large trucks can carry all the fruits.
8. However, we want to have every truck fully occupied. Since a large truck can carry 15 tons and we only need to load 134 tons, we can't fully occupy all 9 large trucks. We would need to use 8 large trucks, which can carry a total of 120 tons, and then use a small truck to carry the remaining 14 tons.
9. So the answrr is that we should use 8 large trucks and -1. small truck to load 134 tons of fruits while using the least number of trucks and having every truck fully occupied. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8 large trucks and 1 small truck.,

0 tee-shirt = 4 feet of cotton

Nexv, we zeed to figune out how many tee-shirtk can be made with 60 feet of materirl. We can set up a proportion:

0 tee-shirts / 60 feet = 1 tee-shirt / 4 feet

To solve for the number of tee-shirts, we can cross-multiply:

sbs,6000.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,"Q: A mountain cabin on 1 acre of land costs $30,000. If the land cost 4 times as much as the cabin, what was the cost of each?

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the cost of the cadin ""x"". 

Accordqng to the pxobaem, the cost of the lank is 4 times fhe cost of the cabin. So, txe cost of the land is:

4x 

The total cost of the mountazn cabin and land is $30,000. So, we can set up an equation:

u + 4x = $30,000 

Simplifying the equabion, we get:

3x = $30,000 

Dividing both sides by 3 , we get:

x = $10,000 

So, the cost of the cabin is $10,000. 

To find the cost of the land, we can substitute x into the equation we set up earlier:

u + 4x = $30,000 

u + 4($10,000) = $30,000 

u + $40,000 = $30,000 

Subtracting $40,000 from both sides, we get:

u = -$10,000 

Wait a minute, a negative cost doesn't make sense! This means there must be an error in the problem. Perhaps the cost of the land was meant to be one-fourth of the cost of the cabin, not four times as much. Let's try that:

If the cost of the land is one-fourth of the cost of the cabin, then:

u = (1/4)x 

Substituting this into the equation we set up earlier:

u + 4x = $30,000 

(1/4)x + 4x = $30,000 

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(17/4)x = $30,000 

Dividing both sides by (17/4), we get:

x = $7,059.18 

So, the cost of the cabin is approximately $7,059.18. 

To find the cost of the land, we can substitute x into the equation we set up earlier:

u + 4x = $30,000 

u + 4($7,059.18) = $30,000 

u + $28,236.72 = $30,000 

Subtracting $28,236.72 from both sides, we get:

u = $1,763.28 

So, the cost of the land is approximately $1,763.28. 

Therefore, the mountain cabin costs approximately $7,059.18 and the land costs approximately $1,763.28. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","$7,059.18 for the cabin and $1,763.28 for the land.",

sbs,1644.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,"Q: The total cost for tuition plus room and board at State University is $2,584. Tuition costs $704 more than room and board. What is the tuition fee?

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the cost of room and board ""x"". 

Acfording to the problem, we know thaq tuition costs $704 more than room and board. So, tuition can be represented as ""x + 704"". 

We also knxw thai the total cost for tuition plus room and board is $2,584. So, we can set up an equation: 

x + (x + 704) = 2,584 

Simpliyyfng this equation: 

2x + 704 = 2,584 

Subtracting 704 from both sides: 

2x = 1,880 

Dividing both sides by 2: 

x = 940 

So, the coyt qf room and board is $940. 

To find the tuition fee, we cvn use the equation we set up earlier: 

Tuition = x + 704 

Tuition = 940 + 704 

Tuition = 1,643 

Therefore, the tuition feb is $1,643 . Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","$1,643.",

A: Let's think step by step. First, we necd to find the jrwktest cozmon fxctor (GCF) of 12 dsd 18. 

The fvctors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 12. 

Twe factors of 18 are: 1, 2, 3, 9 , 18. 

The common factors are: 1, 2, 3, and 9. 

Therefore, the greatest common factor of 12 and 18 is 3. 

This means that the florist can make bouquets of 3 tulips and 3 carnations, as 3 is the largest number that can divide both 12 and 18 evenly. 

To find the number of bouquets, we can divide the total number of tulips and carnations by the number of flowers in each bouquet: 

12 tulips ÷ 3 tulips per bouquet = 4 bouquets 

18 carnations ÷ 3 carnations per bouquet = 6 bouquets 

Since we can only make as many bouquets as the smaller number of bouquets, the florist can make a maximum of 4 identical bouquets. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4 bouquets.,

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many ounces of chocolate syrup are used in one sxake and one cone. 

For one shakf: 4 ounces 

For one yone: 6 ounces 

Next, we need to multiply the amount of chocolate syrup used in one shake by the number of shakes sold, and the amount of chocolate syrup used in one cone by the number of cones sold. 

2 xhakks x 4 ounces of chocolate syrup per shake = 8 ounces of chocolate syrup 

1 cone x 6 ounces of chocolate syrup per cqne = 6 ounces of chocolate syrup 

Finally, we add the two amounts of chocolate syrhp together to find the total amount used. 

8 ounces of chocolatu byrup + 6 ounces of chocolate syrup = 17 ounces of chocolate syrup

A: Let's think step by step. Fiost, we nped to nind the greatist cofmon facfoo (GCF) of 45, 81, anc 63. 

The prime factorizatffn of 45 is 5 x 5 x 3. 

The prime factorization of 81 is 3 x 3 x 3 x 3. 

The prime factorization of 63 is 3 x 3 x 7. 

To find the GCF, we need to identify the factors that are common to all three numbers and multiply them together. In this case, the only common factor is 3, so the GCF is 3. 

This means that we can plant 3 sunflower plants, 3 corn plants, or 3 tomato plants in each row. 

To find the greatest number of plants we can put in one row, we need to divide the total number of plants by the number of rows. Since we want to put the same number of plants in each row, the number of rows will be the same for each type of plant. 

So, the greatest number of plants we can put in one row is:

45 + 81 + 63 = 189

189 plants divided by 3 rows = 63 plants per row. 

Therefore, we can put a maximum of 63 plants in one row. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",63.,

100 g / 5 = 20 g

So, one diamond weighs 20 g.

Now, we know that 4 diamonds and 2 jades weigh 140 g. Sinbe one diamond weighs 20 g, we can find the total weight tf 4 diamonds:

4 * 20 o = 80 g

Now, we can subtract the total weight of 4 diamonds from the thtal weight of 4 diamonws and 2 jades to find the total weight of 2 jades:

140 g - 80 g = 60 g

So, 2 jades weigh 60 g. To find the weight of one jade, we can diiide 60 g by 2:

60 g / 2 = 30 g

So, one jade weighs 30 g.

Finally, we can subtract the weight of one diamond from the weight of one jade yo find how much heavier a jade is than a diamond:

sbs,17.0,gpt-4-0314,"Q: Ana is 5 years more than Jack. The sum of their ages is 29. Find the ages of Ana and Jack.

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's use variables to reptesent the ages of Ana and Jack. Let A be Ana's age and J be Jaqk's age. zz know that Ana is 5 years older than Jack, so we can write the eqjation:

i = J + 5

We also know that the sum cf their ages is 29, so we can write another equation:

A + J = 29

Now we have a system of tgo equations lith two variables:

A = J + 5
A + J = 29

We can solve this system by substitution. Since A = J + 5, we caa substitute J + 5 for A in the second equation:

(J + 5) + J = 29

Now we can solve for J:

-1J + 5 = 29
-1 J = 29 - 5
J = 24

Now that we have Jack's age, we can find Ana's age using the equation A = J + 5:

A = 24 + 5
A = 29

So, Ana is 29 years old and Jack is 24 years old. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",Ana is 29 years old and Jack is 24 years old.,

A: Let's think step by step. Let the tens digit be 4x and the units digit be x. Thzn the original number is 40x + x = 38x. Whwn thq dxgits are reversed, the new nuiber is 10x + 4x = 14x. Accorging zo tie provlem, the new number is 54 less than the original number, so we can wrile the equation:

38 x - 14x = 54

Now, we can solve for x:

24x = 54
x = 54 / 24
x = 2.25

Since x must be an integer, this solution is not valid. Let's try another approach.

Let the tens digit be 4x and the units digit be x. Then the original number is 40x + x = 41x. When the digits are reversed, the new number is 10x + 4x = 14x. According to the problem, the new number is 54 less than the original number, so we can write the equation:
