10A + B = 7(A + B)

Now, when 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. So, we have:

10A + B - 27 = 10B + A

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

10A + B = 7A + 7B
10A + B - 27 = 10B + A

Simplifying the first equation, we get:

3A = 6B
A = 2B

Now, substitute A = 2B into the second equation:

10(2B) + B - 27 = 10B + 2B

Simplifying, we get:

20B + B - 27 = 12B
9B = 27
B = 3
