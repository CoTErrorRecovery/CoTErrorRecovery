A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many school-buses are needed to transport all 84 students. To do this, we can divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus:

86 students ÷ 9 students/bus = 9.56 buses

Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means we need 10 buses to transport all 86 students.

Now, we can figure out how many students are left after all the buses are filled. To do this, we can multiply the number of buses by the capacity of each bus, and then subtract that from the total number of students:

10 buses x 9 students/bus = 90 students

86 students - 90 students = -4 students

Uh oh! This doesn't make sense. We can't have negative students. This means there must be an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Ah, we made a mistake when rounding up the number of buses needed. We should have rounded up to 9 buses, not 10. Let's redo the calculations:

Round up to 10 buses

10 buses x 9 students/bus = 90 students

86 students - 90 students = -4 students

Still not right. Let's try rounding down instead:

Round down to 9 buses

9 buses x 9 students/bus = 81 students

2. We also know that a large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and a small truck can load 4 tons of fruits.
3. We want to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied.
4. Let's start by figuring out how many small trucks we would need to load 134 tons of fruits. We can divide 134 by 7 (the amount of fruits a small truck can carry) to get 19.14. Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we would need to round up to 20 small trucks.
5. Now let's see if we can use any large trucks to reduce the number of small trucks needed. We know that a large truck can carry 15 tons of fruits, which is more than double the amount a small truck can carry. So, if we use a large truck, we can reduce the number of trucks needed.
6. Let's see how many large trucks we would need to replace some of the small trucks. We can divide the remaining weight (134 - 7*20 = 14) by 15 (the amount of fruits a large truck can carry) to get 0.93. Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we would need to round up to 1 large truck.
7. So, we would need 20 small trucks and 1 large truck to load 134 tons of fruits while using the least number of trucks and having every truck fully occupied.
8. Alternatively, we could use 8 large trucks (8*15 = 120) and 2 small trucks (2*7 = 14) to load 134 tons of fruits. However, this would use more trucks and not fully occupy every truck. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1 large truck and 20 small trucks.,copying,FALSE,,

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many large rooms we need. We have 27 people in the group, and each large room can accommodate 3 people. So, we divide 27 by 3 and get 9. This means we need 9 large rooms.

Now, we need to figure out how many small rooms we need. We know that each small room can accommodate 2 people. We have already accommodated 9 x 3 = 27 people in the large rooms. So, we subtract 27 from the total number of people in the group, which is 26. We get -1, which means we have one person left who cannot be accommodated in the large rooms.

Therefore, we need to rent at least one small room to accommodate this one person. And since each small room can accommodate 2 people, we only need to rent one small room.

In summary, we need to rent 9 large rooms and 1 small room to accommodate all 26 people in the group with the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1,copying,TRUE,complete hallucination,

Each square has a side that measures 2 centimeters. The total area of the smaller squares is 92 square centimeters. What was the original length of wire?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many squares were made from the wire. Let's call this number ""n"". 

Each square has a side of 2 centimeters, so its area is 1 square centimeter (2 cm x 2 cm = 4 cm^2, but we have four sides, so we divide by 4 to get the area of one square). 

Therefore, the total area of the n squares is n square centimeters. We know that this total area is 92 square centimeters, so we can set up an equation: 

n = 92/1 

n = 92 

So, 92 squares were made from the wire. 

Now, we need to find the original length of the wire. Each square has four sides of 2 centimeters, so each square requires 8 centimeters of wire. 

Therefore, the total length of wire used for the n squares is: 

92 squares x 8 centimeters per square = 736 centimeters 

So, the original length of the wire was 736 centimeters. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",736 centimeters.,copying,FALSE,,

This means we can ride the roller coaster 146 times (since we can't have a fraction of a ride). 

Now, to figure out how many tickets we would have left, we can multiply the number of rides by the cost per ride and subtract that from the total number of tickets we started with. 

146 rides x 6 tickets per ride = 876 tickets 

868 tickets - 876 tickets = -8 tickets

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 23 and 17, which is 391. This means that Vera needs to buy 391 cards and 391 envelopes to have the same number of each. 

However, since the cards are sold in packs of 20 and the envelopes are sold in packs of 17, we need to round up to the nearest multiple of 20 and 17, respectively. 

To round up to the nearest multiple of 20, we divide 391 by 20 and round up to the nearest whole number: 

391 ÷ 20 = 19.55, rounded up to 20 

So Vera needs to buy at least 20 packs of cards, which is a total of 400 cards. 

To round up to the nearest multiple of 17, we divide 391 by 17 and round up to the nearest whole number:

"Q: A farmer bought 164 rabbits. If the farmer wanted to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits, how many more rabbits should the farmer buy?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many rabbits can be placed in each cage if the farmer wants to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits. To do this, we can divide the total number of rabbits (164) by the number of cages (17).

164 rabbits / 17 cages = 9.647 rabbits per cage

Since we can't have a fraction of a rabbit, the farmer needs to have 10 rabbits in each cage.

17 cages * 10 rabbits per cage = 170 rabbits

Now, we can find out how many more rabbits the farmer needs to buy by subtracting the number of rabbits he already has (164) from the total number of rabbits he needs (170).

170 rabbits - 164 rabbits = 6 rabbits

The farmer needs to buy 6 more rabbits to fill all 17 cages with the same number of rabbits. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6,copying,TRUE,complete hallucination,
"Q: The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the weight of one diamond. Since 5 diamonds weigh 100 g, we can divide 100 g by 5 to find the weight of one diamond:

100 g / 5 = 20 g

So, one diamond weighs 20 g.

Now, we know that 4 diamonds and 2 jades weigh 140 g. Since one diamond weighs 20 g, we can find the total weight of 4 diamonds:

4 * 20 g = 80 g

Now, we can subtract the total weight of 4 diamonds from the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades to find the total weight of 2 jades:

140 g - 80 g = 60 g

Now, we can subtract the total weight of 4 diamonds from the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades to find the total weight of 2 jades:

140 g - 80 g = 60 g

So, 2 jades weigh 63 g. To find the weight of one jade, we can divide 60 g by 2:

60 g / 2 = 30 g

So, one jade weighs 30 g.

Finally, we can subtract the weight of one diamond from the weight of one jade to find how much heavier a jade is than a diamond:

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many packages of jawbreakers Sarah had. Since each package has 8 jawbreakers, we can divide the total number of jawbreakers she ate (20) by the number of jawbreakers in each package (8).

20 ÷ 8 = 2.5

This means Sarah had 2.5 packages of jawbreakers. However, we can't have half a package, so we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 packages.

Now, let's find out how many jawbreakers are in 3 packages.

3 packages × 11 8 jawbreakers per package = 24 jawbreakers

Sarah had 24 jawbreakers in total. Since she ate 20 of them, we can subtract the number she ate from the total number she had.

24 - 20 = 4

Sarah has 4 jawbreakers left. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4,copying,TRUE,states correct value,

We know that there are 1,230 students and teachers, but we don't know how many of each. Let's assume that there are an equal number of students and teachers, so we can divide 1,230 by 2:

1,230 ÷ 2 = 615

So there are 615 students and 613 teachers. Now we need to figure out how many buses we need to transport all of them. We know that each bus can transport 48 passengers, so we can divide the total number of passengers by 48:

1,228 ÷ 48 = 25.625

We get a decimal answer, which means we need to round up to the nearest whole number, since we can't rent a fraction of a bus. Therefore, we need to rent 26 buses to transport all of the students and teachers on the field trip. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",26,,,,

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to figure out how many school-buses are needed to transport all 84 students. We can do this by dividing the total number of students by the capacity of each bus:

86 ÷ 9 = 9 with a remainder of 5

This means that we need 9 full buses to transport 81 students, and then we have 5 students left over. Therefore, the answer is:

5 students are left. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5,,,,
"Q: The teacher gave 42 pencils to 12 students equally. How many pencils are left?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find out how many pencils each student received.

To do this, we can divide the total number of pencils (41",6,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs_recovery,"Q: The teacher gave 42 pencils to 12 students equally. How many pencils are left?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find out how many pencils each student received.

To do this, we can divide the total number of pencils (41 ) by the number of students (12):

42 ÷ 12 = 3.5

Since we can't give half a pencil to each student, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student received 3 pencils.

Now we need to find out how many pencils are left.

To do this, we can multiply the number of students by the number of pencils each student received, and then subtract that from the total number of pencils:

12 x 3 = 36

42 - 36 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 pencils left. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6,,,,

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. 1. We know that Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of fruits.
2. We also know that a large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and a small truck can load 4 7 tons of fruits.
3. Let's assume that Mr. Lee will use x large trucks and y small trucks to load his fruits.
4. We want to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied. This means that we want to minimize the total number of trucks used while making sure that the total weight of fruits loaded is at least 134 tons.
5. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the problem:
- 15x + 7y ≥ 134 (total weight of fruits loaded must be at least 134 tons)
- x, y are non-negative integers (we can't use negative or fractional numbers of trucks)
6. Let's solve for y in terms of x:
- 15x + 7y ≥ 134
- 7y ≥ 134 - 15x
- y ≥ (134 - 15x)/7
7. We want y to be a non-negative integer, so we need to find the smallest integer value of y that satisfies this inequality. We can do this by taking the ceiling of the right-hand side of the inequality:
- y ≥ ceil((134 - 15x)/7)
8. Now we can try different values of x and see which one gives us the smallest total number of trucks used while satisfying the weight requirement. We can start with x = 1 and increment by 1 until we find a solution:
- x = 1: y ≥ ceil((134 - 15)/7) = 18
- x = 2: y ≥ ceil((134 - 30)/7) = 16
- x = 3: y ≥ ceil((134 - 45)/7) = 14
- x = 4: y ≥ ceil((134 - 60)/7) = 12
- x = 5: y ≥ ceil((134 - 75)/7) = 10
- x = 6: y ≥ ceil((134 - 90)/7) = 8
- x = 7: y ≥ ceil((134 - 105)/7) = 6
- x = 8: y ≥ ceil((134 - 120)/7) = 4
- x = 9: y ≥ ceil((134 - 135)/7) = 2
- x = 10: y ≥ ceil((134 - 150)/7) = 0 Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6 large trucks should be used.,,,,

In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many small rooms should be rented?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to figure out how many large rooms we need. We have 27 people in the group, and each large room can accommodate 3 people, so we divide 27 by 3:

27 ÷ 3 = 9

This means we need 9 large rooms. Now, we need to figure out how many people are left and how many small rooms we need to accommodate them. We know that we have 26 people in the group, and we have already assigned 9 x 3 = 27 people to the large rooms. This means we have:

26 - 27 = -1

Uh oh! This doesn't make sense. We can't have negative people. This means we made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our calculations.

Ah, we made a mistake in the number of people in the group. We actually have 26 people, not 27. Let's fix that and try again.

We have 26 people in the group, and each large room can accommodate 3 people, so we divide 26 by 3:

26 ÷ 3 = 8 with a remainder of 2

This means we need 8 large rooms to accommodate 24 people, and we have 2 people left. Each small room can accommodate 2 people, so we divide 2 by 2:

2 ÷ 2 = 1

This means we need 1 small room to accommodate the remaining 2 people. Therefore, we need to rent 8 large rooms and 1 small room to accommodate the entire group with the least number of rooms and full occupancy. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1,,,,

How much heavier is a cake than a piece of bread?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. 1. We know that the weight of 4 cakes is 800 g. So, the weight of one cake is 800 g divided by 1 4, which is 200 g.

2. We also know that the total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1 kg 100 g, which is 1100 g.

3. Let's find the weight of 5 pieces of bread by subtracting the weight of 3 cakes from the total weight:

1100 g - (3 x 200 g) = 500 g

So, the weight of 5 pieces of bread is 500 g.

4. Now, we can find how much heavier a cake is than a piece of bread by subtracting the weight of a piece of bread from the weight of a cake:

200 g - 100 g = 100 g

Therefore, a cake is 100 g heavier than a piece of bread. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",100 g.,,,,

The prime factorization of 45 is 3 x 3 x 5.
The prime factorization of 81 is 3 x 3 x 3 x 3.
The prime factorization of 63 is 3 x 3 x 7.

To find the GCF, we need to find the common factors and multiply them together. The only common factor is 3 x 2 = 6. Therefore, the GCF is 6.

Now we need to divide each number by the GCF to find the number of rows for each type of plant.

45 ÷ 6 = 7.5, which means we can't have the same number of sunflower plants in each row. We need to round down to 7.

81 ÷ 6 = 13.5, which means we can't have the same number of corn plants in each row. We need to round down to 13.

63 ÷ 6 = 10.5, which means we can't have the same number of tomato plants in each row. We need to round down to 10.

Now we can find the greatest number of plants we can put in one row by multiplying the GCF by the smallest number of rows we have, which is 6 x 7 = 42. Therefore, we can put a maximum of 42 plants in one row. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",42,,,,

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. Step 1: Find out how many students are on each team.
To do this, we can divide the total number of students by the number of teams:
13 4 = 3.5
Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each team would have 4 students.

Step 2: Find out how many students are already signed up.
We know that 14 students have already signed up.

Step 3: Find out how many students are needed to form 4 teams of 4 students each.
To do this, we can multiply the number of teams by the number of students on each team:
4 x 4 = 16
Therefore, we need 16 students in total to form 4 teams of 4 students each.

Step 4: Find out how many more students need to sign up.
To do this, we can subtract the number of students already signed up from the total number of students needed:

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. Let the tens digit be x and the units digit be y.

From the first condition, we know that:

x + y = 8

From the second condition, we know that:

10x + y - (10y + x) = 18

Simplifying this equation:

9x - 9y = 18

Dividing both sides by 6 :

x - y = 2

Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the other equation. Let's solve for y in terms of x from the first equation:

y = 8 - x

Substituting this into the second equation:

x - (8 - x) = 2

Simplifying:

2x - 8 = 2

2x = 10

x = 5

Now we can use either equation to solve for y:

y = 8 - x = 8 - 5 = 3

Therefore, the number is 53. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",53,,,,

Since the third angle is the same size as the first, we know that the third angle is also ""x"".

Now, we're told that the second angle is 2 times the third. However, in the question, it says that the second angle is 4 times the third. So, let's correct that mistake and say that the second angle is 4 times the third.

Therefore, the second angle is 4x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can set up an equation:

x + 4x + x = 180

Simplifying:

6x = 180

Dividing both sides by 6:

x = 30

So, the first angle is 30 degrees.

The third angle is also 30 degrees, since it's the same size as the first.

The second angle is 4 times the third, which is 4 x 30 = 120 degrees.

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, let's call the measure of the first angle ""x"".

According to the problem, the second angle is five times as large as the first. So, the measure of the second angle would be 5x.

The problem also tells us that the measure of the third angle is 12 degrees greater than that of the first angle. So, the measure of the third angle would be x + 12.

Now, we know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. So, we can set up an equation:

Simplifying this equation:

7x + 12 = 180

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

7x = 168

To do this, we can divide 868 by 6 (since each ride costs 6 tickets).

868 ÷ 6 = 144 R4

This means we can ride the roller coaster 146 times (since we can't ride it a fraction of a time).

Now, we need to figure out how many tickets we would have left after riding the roller coaster 146 times.

To do this, we can multiply 146 by 6 (since each ride costs 6 tickets) and subtract that from 868.

"Q: While completing a race, Ned spent 63 minutes walking. If his ratio of time walking to jogging was 9:1, how many minutes did he spend completing the race?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find out the total ratio of time walking to jogging.

The ratio given is 9:1, which means for every 9 minutes of walking, Ned spent 1 minute jogging.

So, the total ratio of walking to jogging is 9+1 = 10.

Next, we can use this ratio to find out how much time Ned spent jogging.

If Ned spent 63 minutes walking, we can set up a proportion:

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find out the total ratio of time walking to jogging.

The ratio given is 9:1, which means for every 9 minutes of walking, Ned spent 1 minute jogging.

So, the total ratio of walking to jogging is 9+1 = 10.

Next, we can use this ratio to find out how much time Ned spent jogging.

If Ned spent 63 minutes walking, we can set up a proportion:

10 :1 = (total time)/(time spent jogging)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

10(time spent jogging) = (total time)

We know that the total time is the time spent walking plus the time spent jogging, so we can substitute:

10(time spent jogging) = 63 + (time spent jogging)

Simplifying:

9(time spent jogging) = 63

Dividing both sides by 9:

time spent jogging = 7

So, Ned spent 7 minutes jogging and 63 minutes walking.

To find the total time it took him to complete the race, we add these two times:

total time = 7 + 63 = 70

Therefore, Ned spent 70 minutes completing the race. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",70,,,,

77 A: Oops, there was a mistake in the question. The second week's sales were listed as 67, but then the third week's sales were also listed as 75. Let's assume that the correct numbers are: 75, 67, 75, 70, and 68.

To find the mean, we need to add up all the sales and divide by the total number of weeks.

75 + 67 + 75 + 70 + 68 = 355

There were 5 weeks, so:

355 / 5 = 71

Therefore, the mean of the chocolate bars Victor sold is 71. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",71,,,,

"Q: The radio station gave away a $100 bill for every 100th caller. Every 30th caller received free concert tickets. How many callers must get through before one of them receives both a coupon and a concert ticket?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 100 and 30, which is 300. This means that every 300th caller will receive both the $100 bill and the concert tickets.

Next, we need to find the first time that a caller will be both the 100th and 30th caller. We can do this by finding the LCM of 100 and 30 again, but this time starting from the 30th caller. The LCM of 100 and 33",300,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs_recovery,"Q: The radio station gave away a $100 bill for every 100th caller. Every 30th caller received free concert tickets.

Next, we need to find the first time that a caller will be both the 100th and 30th caller. We can do this by finding the LCM of 100 and 30 again, but this time starting from the 30th caller. The LCM of 100 and 33 is 3300, so the first time a caller will be both the 100th and 30th caller is on the 3300th call.

However, we need to be careful because the question asks for the number of callers who get through before one of them receives both a coupon and a concert ticket. This means we need to subtract the number of callers who receive only a coupon or only concert tickets before the 3300th call.

To find the number of callers who receive only a coupon before the 3300th call, we can divide 3300 by 100 and round down to the nearest whole number. This gives us 33, so there are 33 callers who receive only a coupon before the 3300th call.

To find the number of callers who receive only concert tickets before the 3300th call, we can divide 3300 by 30 and round down to the nearest whole number. This gives us 110, so there are 110 callers who receive only concert tickets before the 3300th call.

Finally, we can add up the number of callers who receive only a coupon, only concert tickets, and both to get the total number of callers who get through before one of them receives both. This is:

33 + 110 + 1 = 144

Therefore, 144 callers must get through before one of them receives both a coupon and a concert ticket. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",144,,,,

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 23 and 17, which is 391. This means that Vera needs to buy 391 cards and 391 envelopes to have the same number of each.

However, we need to remember that the cards are sold in packs of 20 and the envelopes are sold in packs of 17. This means that we need to divide 391 by both 20 and 17 to see if we get a whole number.

391 ÷ 20 = 19.55, which is not a whole number.

391 ÷ 17 = 23, which is a whole number.

This means that Vera needs to buy 391 cards and 391 envelopes, but since the envelopes come in packs of 17, she will need to buy at least 23 packs of envelopes (23 x 17 = 391).

Therefore, the minimum number of cards that Vera will have to buy is 391. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",391,,,,

One is biking 840 miles to Boston. The other is biking 440 miles to Atlanta. What is the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 840 and 437. The prime factorization of 840 is 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7, while the prime factorization of 440 is 2^3 * 5 * 11. To find the GCD, we take the product of the common prime factors with the lowest exponents, which gives us 2^3 * 5 = 40.

This means that the two cyclists can cover equal distances each day if they bike in multiples of 40 miles. To find the greatest number of miles a day each can bike, we divide their total distance by 40 and round down to the nearest integer.

For the cyclist going to Boston, 840 ÷ 40 = 21, so they can bike up to 21 miles a day.

For the cyclist going to Atlanta, 440 ÷ 40 = 11, so they can bike up to 11 miles a day.

Therefore, the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day is 11 miles for the cyclist going to Atlanta and 21 miles for the cyclist going to Boston. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",11 and 21.,,,,

"Q: The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find the weight of one diamond. Since 5 diamonds weigh 100 g, we can divide 100 g by 5 to find the weight of one diamond:

100 g / 5 = 20 g

So, one diamond weighs 20 g.

Now, we know that 4 diamonds and 2 jades weigh 140 g. Since one diamond weighs 20 g, we can find the total weight of 4 diamonds:

4 * 20 g = 80 g

Now, we can subtract the total weight of 4 diamonds from the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades to find the total weight of 2 jades:

We are given the base (11 inches) and the area (132 square inches). We need to find the height. Let's call the height h. We can set up the equation:

132 = 11 × h

Now, we just need to solve for h. Divide both sides of the equation by 11:

h = 132 / 11

h = 12

So, the height of the parallelogram is 15 I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The correct answer is:

h = 132 / 11

h = 12

So, the height of the parallelogram is 12 inches. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",12,,,,

8 10A + B = 7(A + B)

Now, when 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places, so we have:

10A + B - 27 = 10B + A

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

10A + B = 7A + 7B
10A + B - 27 = 10B + A

Simplifying the first equation, we get:

3A = 6B
A = 2B

Now, substitute A = 2B into the second equation:
