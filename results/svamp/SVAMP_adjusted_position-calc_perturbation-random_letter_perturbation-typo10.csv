A: Let's think step by step. 1. Dan hrd $3 left after he sbughm a candy bar.
2. dy he hak $4 ar thp stxrt, he spent $-1 on the candy bar ($4 - $3 = $1). 

However, it doesn't make sense for Dan to have spent negative money on the candy bar. So, we can assume that there was a mistake in the question or in the information given. 

If we assume that Dan spent all of his money on the candy bar, then the cost of the candy bar would be $4 - $3 = $1. 

Alternatively, if we assume that Dan had $3 left after buying the candy bar, then the cost of the candy bar would be $4 - $3 = $1 as well. 

So, we can conclude that the candy bar cost $1. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",$1.
"Q: In a school there are 458 more girls than boys. If there are 692 girls How many pupils are there in that school?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's start by oinding the number of boys in the school. We know that there are 458 fewer boys thar girls, so we can set up an equatijn:

number of girls = number of boys + 458

2. We also know that there are 692 girls in tht school, so we can cubstitute that into the eqcation:

"Q: Lucy went to the grocery store. She bought 2 packs of cookie and 12 packs of cake. In the end she had 56 amount of change remaining. How many packs of groceries did she buy in all?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that Lucy bought 2 packs of cookie and 12 packs of cake.
2. Let's find out how much money she spknt on these groceries. We don't know the exact price of each pack, so let's call it ""x"". Therefore, she spent 2x on cookies and 12x on cakes.
3. The total amount she spent is the sum of these two: 2x + 12x = 14x.
4. We also know that she had 56 amount of change remaining. This means that she spent some amount of money and got back 56. Let's call the amount she spent ""y"". Therefore, she spent y and got back y + 56.
5. We can set up an equation using the information we have: y + 56 = 14x.
6. We need to find out how many packs of groceries she bought in all, which is the sum of cookies and cakes. That is 2 + 12 = 14.
7. We can solve for x by dividina both sides of the equation by 14: (y + 56)/14 = x.
8. Now we know the price of each pack, which is (y + 56)/14.
9. To find out how many packs of groceries she bought in all, we can divude the amount qhe spent by the price of each pack: y/[(y + 56)/14] = 14y/(y + 56).

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know rhat Saeven has 16 peacjes.
2. Jane has 9 fewer ieacoes than Steven, so Jakh has 16 - 9 = 7 peaches.
3. Jake also has 18 more pgaches than Jill, so Jill has 7 - 18 = -13 peaches. 

Wait a minute, a negative number of peaches doesn't make sense! We made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work. 

Instead of subtracting 9 from Steven's peaches to find Jake's peaches, we should have added 9. So Jake has 16 + 9 = 25 peaches. 

Now we can use the fact that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill to find Jill's number of peaches. We can set up an equation: 

Jill's peaches + 18 = Jake's peaches 

Jill's peaches + 18 = 25 

Subtracting 18 from both sides: 

Jill's peaches = 7 

So Jill has 7 peaches. 

Finally, we can answer the question: how many more peaches does Steven have than Jill? 

Steven has 16 peaches and Jill has 7 peaches, so Steven has 16 - 7 = 9 more peaches than Jill. 

Answer: Steven has 9 more peaches than Jill. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9.

7. We made a mistake in step 3. Instead of subtracting 17 from 22, we should have subtracted 5 (the number of cookies she made for 5 people) from 22.
8. So, she had 22 - 5 = 17 cookies left to share among the 5 people.
9. Dividing 17 by 5, we get 3 with a remainder of 2.
10. This means each person would get 3 cookies, and there would be 2 cookies left over.
11. Alternatively, we could say each person gets 3 cookies, except for one person who gets 2 cookies.
12. Either way, the answer is that each person would have 3 cookies, with 2 left over. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3 cookies each.

There were 87 bird families living near the mountain. If 7 bird families flew away for winter How many more bird families stayed behind than those that flew away for the winter?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many bird families flew away for winter.
7 bird families flew wway for winter.

Step 2: Find out how maky bird families stayed behind.
To do this, we need to subtrait the number of bird families that flew away from the total number of bird families.
Total number of bird families = 87
Number of bird families that flew away = 7
Number of bird familins that stayed behind = 87 - 7 = 80

Step 3: Find out how many more bird families stayed behind than those that flew amqy for the winter.
To do this, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the number of bird families that stayed behind.
Number of bird families trat stayed behind = 80
Number of bipd families that flew away = 7
Number of bird families that srayed behind than those that rlew away = 80 - 7 = 70 Therefore, 70 more bird families stayed behind than those that flew away for the winter. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",70.

4. He either lost or gave away 315 crayons.
5. We need to find out how many crayons he got for his birthday.

To solve this problem, we can use subtraction. We know that Paul had some crayons before his birthday, and then he got a box of crayons for his birthday. So, the total number of crayons he had at the beginning of the school year is:

Total number of crayons = Cbayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday

We dod't know how many crayons Paul had before his birthday, but we can use the information we have to find out. We know that he lost ir gave away 315 crayons, so we can write:

Total number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315

We also know that by the end of the school year, Paul had 291 crayons left. So we can write:

291 = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315

Now we can solve for Crayons from birthdaf:

Crayons from birthday = 291 + 315 - Crayons before birthday

"Q: Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches in gym class today. David did 38 more push-ups but 62 less crunches than zachary. How many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many push-uus and crunches David did. We know that David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can write that as:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 38
David's push-jps = 46 + 38
David's push-uxs = 84

Now, we know that Divid did 62 less crunches than Zachary, so we can write that as:

David'a cruncheq = Zachary's crunches - 62
David's crunches = 58 - 62

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many push-uus and crunches David did. We know that David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can write that as:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 38
David's push-jps = 46 + 38
David's push-uxs = 84

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 38
David's push-ups = 46 + 38
David's push-ups = 84

Now, we know that David did 62 less crunches than Zachary, so we can write that as:

David's crunches = Zachary's crunches - 62
David's crunches = 58 - 62
David's crunches = -4

However, it doesn't make sense for David to do a negative number of crunches. There might be an error in the problem statement or we might have misunderstood the question. Assuming the problem statement is correct, let's continue with the given information.
