"Q: Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's start by using variables to represent the number of apples each person has. Let's call Adam's number of apples ""A"" and Jackie's number of apples ""J"". 

2. We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so we can write an equation: 

A = J + 4

5. We also know that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, so we can write another equation: J = J + 18, where J is the number of peaches Jill has.
6. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get: S - 9 = J + 18.
7. We know that Steven has 16 peaches, so we can substitute S = 16 into the equation: 16 - 9 = J + 18.
8. Simplifying the equation, we get: J = 7.
9. So Jake has 7 peaches and Jill has 7 - 18 = -10 peaches. Again, this doesn't make sense, so we made a mistake somewhere.
10. Let's try one more time. We know that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can write an equation: J = S - 9, where J is the number of peaches Jake has and S is the number of peaches Steven has.
11. We also know that Steven has 16 peaches, so we can substitute S = 16 into the equation: J = 16 - 9.
12. Simplifying the equation, we get: J = 7.
13. We also know that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, so we can write another equation: J = J + 18, where J is the number of peaches Jill has.
14. Substituting J = 7 into the equation, we get: 7 = J + 18.
15. Solving for J, we get: J = -11.
16. This still doesn't make sense, so we made a mistake somewhere.
17. After checking our work, we realize that there is no solution to this problem. If Steven has 16 peaches and Jake has 9 fewer peaches, then Jake would have 7 peaches. But if Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, then Jill would have to have negative peaches, which is impossible. Therefore, there is no answer to this question. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",N/A or there is no answer.,FALSE,calculation,,

"Q: There were 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase. How many orchids did she cut?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with the initial number of roses and orchids in the vase.

Initial number of roses = 12
Initial number of orchids = 2

Step 2: Add the number of roses and orchids Jessica cut from her garden.

Let's say Jessica cut x roses and y orchids.

New number of roses = 12 + x
New number of orchids = 2 + y

Step 3: Use the information given in the problem to form equations.

From the problem, we know that after Jessica cut some more flowers, there are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase. So we can form two equations:

New number of roses = 10
New number of orchids = 21

Substituting the expressions we formed earlier, we get:

12 + x = 10
2 + y = 21

Simplifying each equation, we get:

x = -2
y = 21

"Q: There are 203 bananas and 63 oranges in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 7 groups and oranges are organized into 95 groups How big is each group of bananas?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bananas are in each group. 

To do this, we can divide the total number of bananas (203) by the number of groups (7): 

203 รท 7 = 29 

So each group of bananas has 29 bananas. 

Next, we need to find out how big each group of oranges is. 

To do this, we can divide the total number of oranges (63) by the number of groups (95): 

63 รท 95 = -1.337 

So each group of oranges has approximately -1.337",29,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: There are 203 bananas and 63 oranges in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 7 groups and oranges are organized into 95 groups How big is each group of bananas?

Next, we need to find out how big each group of oranges is. 

To do this, we can divide the total number of oranges (63) by the number of groups (95): 

63 รท 95 = -1.337 

So each group of oranges has approximately -1.337 oranges. However, this doesn't make sense since we can't have a negative number of oranges in a group. Therefore, we need to check if we made a mistake in our calculation. 

It's possible that we made a typo or error in our calculation, but it's also possible that the number of groups is too large compared to the total number of oranges. Let's check this by calculating the average number of oranges per group if we had fewer groups: 

If we had 10 groups: 

63 รท 10 = 6.3 

If we had 20 groups: 

63 รท 20 = 3.15 

If we had 50 groups: 

63 รท 50 = 1.26 

As we can see, as the number of groups increases, the average number of oranges per group decreases. This means that if we have 95 groups, each group will have a very small number of oranges, which may not be practical or useful. 

Therefore, we may need to reconsider the number of groups for the oranges or find out more information about the context of the problem to determine a reasonable answer. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","29 for the size of each group of bananas, but we cannot determine a reasonable answer for the size of each group of oranges with the given information.",TRUE,other,explicitly identifies error,error unnecessary to final answer

To solve this problem, we can use subtraction. We know that Paul had some crayons before his birthday, and then he got a box of crayons for his birthday. So, the total number of crayons he had at the beginning of the school year is:

Total number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday

We don't know how many crayons Paul had before his birthday, but we can use the information we have to find out. We know that he lost or gave away 315 crayons, so we can write:

"Q: Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers at the park. Now he has 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers in his collection. How many more wrappers than bottle caps does danny have now?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps and wrappers Danny had before he found the new ones at the park. To do this, we can subtract the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found from the total number he has now.

For bottle caps:
27 (total bottle caps now) - 10 (bottle caps found at the park) = 17 (bottle caps before)

For wrappers:
43 (total wrappers now) - 62 (wrappers found at the park) = -19 (wrappers before)

Now we know that Danny had 17 bottle caps and -19 wrappers before. However, having a negative number of wrappers doesn't make sense. So, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or the numbers given.

Assuming that the numbers given are correct, we can still find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny has now.

To do this, we can subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers:

"Q: Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. 1. Let's start by using variables to represent the number of apples each person has. Let's call Adam's number of apples ""A"" and Jackie's number of apples ""J"".

2. We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so we can write an equation:

A = J + 4

3. We also know that together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples, so we can write another equation:

A + J = 14

4. Now we need to find out how many apples Bob has. We know that Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together do, so we can write another equation:

B = A + J + 6

5. We can use the first two equations to solve for A and J:

A = J + 4

A + J = 14

Substituting the first equation into the second equation:

(J + 4) + J = 14

2J + 4 = 14

2J = 10

J = 4

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. 1. David did 51 push-ups.
2. David did 49 more push-ups than Zachary.
3. To find out how many push-ups Zachary did, we need to subtract 49 from David's total: 51 - 49 = -1.
4. So Zachary did -1. Wait a minute, that doesn't make sense! How can someone do negative push-ups?

Let's go back and check our work. We made a mistake in step 3. We should have subtracted 49 from David's total to find out how many push-ups Zachary did, not subtracted Zachary's total from David's total. So let's try again:

1. David did 51 push-ups.
2. David did 49 more push-ups than Zachary.
3. To find out how many push-ups Zachary did, we need to subtract 49 from David's total: 51 - 49 = 2.
4. So Zachary did 2 push-ups.

4. We can set up an equation to solve for x: x + 8 = 10
5. Solving for x, we get x = -1.
6. Therefore, Mary has already put in -1. This doesn't make sense, since you can't have negative cups of flour. So, we made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.
3 cups of sugar + 10 cups of flour = 13 cups total ingredients in the recipe.
If Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar, that means she needs 3+5=8 cups of sugar.
So, the total amount of flour she needs is 8+5=13 cups.
Since she already put in some cups of flour, the equation becomes: x + 13 = 10
Solving for x, we get x = -3.
Again, this doesn't make sense, since you can't have negative cups of flour. So, we made another mistake somewhere.
Let's try a different approach. We know that Mary needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar. So, if she needs 3 cups of sugar, she needs 3+5=8 cups of flour.
If she already put in x cups of flour, then the total amount of flour she has is x+8.
We also know that the total amount of ingredients in the recipe is 13 cups (3 cups of sugar + 10 cups of flour).
So, we can set up an equation: x+8+3 = 13
Simplifying, we get x+11=13
Solving for x, we get x=2.
Therefore, Mary has already put in 2 cups of flour. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2,,,,

"Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 3 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 594 pages. It took Frank 607 days to finish the book. How many pages are in each chapter?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we can use the formula:

total pages = number of chapters x pages per chapter

Since we know the total pages and the number of chapters (3), we can solve for the pages per chapter:

594 = 3 x pages per chapter

pages per chapter = 594 / 3

pages per chapter = 198

So each chapter has 198 pages.

Now, let's use the fact that it took Frank 607 days to finish the book. We can set up another formula:

time to finish book = time per chapter x number of chapters

Since each chapter has the same number of pages, we can assume that Frank spent the same amount of time reading each chapter. Let's call this time per chapter ""t"". Then:

607 = t x 3

t = 607 / 3

t = 199.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

So Frank spent about 199.33",198,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs_recovery,"Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 3 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 594 pages. It took Frank 607 days to finish the book. How many pages are in each chapter?

t = 607 / 3

t = 199.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

So Frank spent about 199.33 days reading each chapter. This makes sense, since each chapter has 198 pages and Frank read the whole book in 607 days, which is a bit more than 3 times the time it takes to read one chapter. We can also check that the total time adds up:

time to finish book = time per chapter x number of chapters

607 = 199.33 x 3

607 = 597.99 (rounded to two decimal places)

This is not exactly equal, but it's close enough given the rounding we did. We can conclude that each chapter has 198 pages and Frank spent about 199.33 days reading each chapter. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",198 pages per chapter.,,,,

Total amount = 120 + 66 = 186 dollars

Now, we need to find the average amount of money made per day in the first 20 days:

Average amount per day = Total amount / Number of days

Number of days = 20

Average amount per day = 120 / 20 = 7 dollars per day

Therefore, the ring toss game made an average of 7 dollars per day in the first 20 days at the carnival. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",7,,,,

"Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. She already put in 12 cups of flour and 10 cups of sugar. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add?

2. Mary already put in 12 cups of flour and 10 cups of sugar.
3. We need to find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add.

4. To do this, we can subtract the amount of sugar Mary has already added from the amount the recipe calls for:

11 cups of sugar - 10 cups of sugar = 4 cup of sugar

5. Mary needs to add 4 more cups of sugar.

Wait, that doesn't seem right! Let's go back and check our work. We made a mistake in step 4 - we subtracted the amount of sugar Mary added from the amount the recipe calls for, instead of subtracting it from the total amount of sugar and flour she has already added. Let's try again:

Total amount of sugar and flour Mary has already added:

12 cups of flour + 10 cups of sugar = 22 cups

Amount of sugar Mary has already added:

10 cups of sugar

Amount of flour Mary has already added:

12 cups of flour

Amount of sugar and flour Mary still needs to add:

11 cups of sugar + 9 cups of flour = 20 cups

To find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we can subtract the total amount of sugar and flour she has already added from the amount she still needs to add:

20 cups - 22 cups = -2 cups

Uh oh, that doesn't make sense either! It looks like Mary has already added more sugar and flour than the recipe calls for. Let's double check the amounts and make sure we didn't misread or mistype anything:

Recipe:

11 cups of sugar + 9 cups of flour

Amount Mary has already added:

12 cups of flour + 10 cups of sugar

It looks like Mary has added more sugar and flour than the recipe calls for, so she doesn't need to add any more sugar. In fact, she has already added 1 cup more sugar than the recipe calls for. She may want to adjust the other ingredients accordingly to make sure the cake turns out correctly. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",0,,,,

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. 1. The recipe calls for 10 cups of flour and she already put in 7 cups, so she needs to add 10 - 7 = 3 more cups of flour.
2. The recipe calls for 2 cups of sugar, so she doesn't need to add any more sugar.
3. To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar she needs to add now, we subtract the amount of sugar from the amount of flour: 3 - 2 = -2.
4. Therefore, Mary needs to add -2. This doesn't make sense as an answer, because we can't add a negative amount of flour. So, we need to double-check our calculations.

5. We made a mistake in step 3. We should have subtracted the amount of sugar from the amount of flour that Mary has already put in, not from the amount she needs to add now. So, we need to subtract 2 from 7 to find out how much more flour than sugar Mary has already put in: 7 - 2 = 5.

6. Now we can subtract the amount of sugar from the amount of flour she still needs to add: 10 - 7 = 3.

7. Finally, we can subtract the amount of sugar from the amount of flour she still needs to add, and then subtract the amount of flour than sugar she has already put in: 3 - 2 - 5 = -4.

8. Again, we have a negative number, which doesn't make sense. This means that Mary has already put in more flour than she needs to add, so she doesn't need to add any more flour than sugar.

9. The answer is 0. Mary doesn't need to add any more cups of flour than cups of sugar. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",0,,,,

"Q: Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he only had 291 crayons left since he had either lost or given away 315 of them. How many crayons did he get for his birthday?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. 1. Paul had some crayons at the beginning of the school year.
2. He got a box of crayons for his birthday.
3. By the end of the school year, he had 291 crayons left.
4. He either lost or gave away 315 crayons.
5. We need to find out how many crayons he got for his birthday.

To solve this problem, we can use subtraction. We know that Paul had some crayons before his birthday, and then he got a box of crayons for his birthday. So, the total number of crayons he had at the beginning of the school year is:

Total number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday

We don't know how many crayons Paul had before his birthday, but we can use the information we have to find out. We know that he lost or gave away 315 crayons, so we can write:

Total number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315

We also know that by the end of the school year, Paul had 291 crayons left. So we can write:

291 = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315

Now we can solve for Crayons from birthday:

Crayons from birthday = 291 + 315 - Crayons before birthday

We don't know Crayons before birthday, but we know that it must be less than or equal to 291 (since Paul had 291 crayons left at the end of the school year). So we can try different values of Crayons before birthday until we find one that works. Let's start with Crayons before birthday = 0:

Crayons from birthday = 291 + 315 - 0 = 603

Crayons from birthday = 291 + 315 - 0 = 603

This means that Paul got 603 crayons for his birthday. However, we need to check if this answer makes sense. If Paul got 603 crayons for his birthday, and he lost or gave away 315 of them, he would have had 288 crayons left at the end of the school year (603 - 315 = 288). But we know that he had 291 crayons left, which is more than 288. This means that our initial assumption that Crayons before birthday = 0 was incorrect. We need to try a smaller value for Crayons before birthday. Let's try Crayons before birthday = 3:

Crayons from birthday = 291 + 315 - 3 = 603

This works! If Paul had 3 crayons before his birthday, and he got 603 crayons for his birthday, he would have had 606 crayons in total. If he lost or gave away 315 of them, he would have had 291 crayons left at the end of the school year, which is what we were given. Therefore, the answer is:

Paul got 603 crayons for his birthday. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",603,,,,

Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends. He had 10 crackers and 8 cakes initially. Since he gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each friend, we need to find the smallest number of items he could have given to each friend.

Let's divide the number of crackers by the number of friends: 10 รท 4 = <<10/4=2.5>>2.5. Since he can't give half a cracker, we know he gave 2 crackers to each friend, which means he gave away 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 crackers in total.

Now, let's see how many cakes he gave away. He had 8 cakes initially, and he gave away the same number of cakes as crackers, so he gave away 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 cakes.

"Q: A waiter had 11 customers. After some left he still had 3 customers. How many more customers left than those that stayed behind?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we know that the waiter had 11 customers and some left. Let's call the number of customers who left L. So, we can write the equation:

11 - L = 3

11 - 3 = 3 + L - 3

This simplifies to:

"Q: Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers at the park. Now he has 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers in his collection. How many more wrappers than bottle caps does danny have now?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps and wrappers Danny had before he found the new ones at the park. To do this, we can subtract the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found from the total number he has now.

For bottle caps:
27 (total bottle caps now) - 10 (bottle caps found at the park) = 17 (bottle caps before)

For wrappers:
43 (total wrappers now) - 62 (wrappers found at the park) = -19 (wrappers before)

Now we know that Danny had 17 bottle caps and -19 wrappers before. However, having a negative number of wrappers doesn't make sense. So, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or the numbers given.

Assuming that the numbers given are correct, we can still find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny has now.

To do this, we can subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers:

43 (total wrappers now) - 27 (total bottle caps now) = 17

"Q: Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together and colors to paint them. He needs a total of 57 g of colors to paint them. He needs 22 g of wax more. If the feathers require a total of 353 g of wax How many grams of wax does he already have?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we know that he needs 22 g more wax than he currently has. So, let's represent the amount of wax he already has as x. Then, x + 22 g is the total amount of wax he needs, which is 353 g.

Now, we can write the equation: x + 22 = 353

To solve for x, we can subtract 22 from both sides of the equation: x = 353 - 22

Now, we can calculate the value of x: x = 328

So, he already has 328",331,gpt-4-0314,sbs_recovery,"Q: Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together and colors to paint them. He needs a total of 57 g of colors to paint them.

"Q: At the zoo, a cage had 3 snakes and 75 alligators. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding How many alligators were not hiding?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we know that there are 75 alligators in total in the cage. We also know that 19 alligators were hiding. To find out how many alligators were not hiding, we simply subtract the number of hiding alligators from the total number of alligators:

75 alligators (total) - 19 alligators (hiding) = 55 alligators (not hiding)
