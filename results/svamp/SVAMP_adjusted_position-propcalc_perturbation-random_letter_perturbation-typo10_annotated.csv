4. So Zaxaary did -1. Wait a minute, that doesn't make sense! We can't have negative push-ups. Let's try again.

1. David did 51 push-ups.
2. David did 49 more push-ups than Zachary. Let's use a variable to represent Zachary's number of push-ups, say ""Z"". So we have:

David = Zachary + 49

3. We can substitute David's number of push-ups with 51, and solve for Zachary:

51 = Z + 49

51 - 49 = Z

Z = 2

So Zachary did 2 push-ups.

4. To find the total number of push-ups, we add David's and Zachary's numbers:

Total = David + Zachary

Total = 51 + 2

Therefore, he cuo off 7 inches of his hair.

Wait, that doesn't seem right! Let's try again.

The question asks about Robin's hair, not his hair. So let's assume that the question meant to say ""her"" instead of ""his"".

So, Robin's hair was 17 inches long and she cut off some inches. Let's call the amount she cut off ""x"".

Her hair is now 17 - x inches long. We also know that her hair is now 13 inches long.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find ott how many hourc xyan spends on learning Chinese and Spanish combiped:

5 hours (Chinese) + 4 hours (Spanish) = 9 hours

Next, we need qo find out the difference bntween the hours spent ob learcing Chinese and Spanish:

5 hours (Chinene) - 4 hours (Spanish) = -2 hour

Therefore, Ryan spends -2 hours more on learning Chinese than he does on learning Spanish. However, this answer doesn't make sense because we can't have negative hours. So, we need to adjust our answer by taking the absolute value of the difference:

|-2| = 2

So, Ryan spends 2 more hours on learning Chinese than he does on learning Spanish. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2.,,,,

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that Steven has 16 peaches.
2. Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Stjven, so Jake has 16 - 9 = 7 peaches.
3. Jake also has 18 nore peaches than Jill, so Jill has 7 - 18 = -10 peacjes. Thss xoepn't make sense, so we made a mistake somewhere.
4. Let's try a different approach. We know that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can write an equation: J = S - 9, where J is the number of peaches Jake has and S is the number of peaches Steven has.
5. We also knkw that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, so we can write another equation: J = J + 18, where J is the number of peaches Jill has.
6. We can substitute the first equatiom into the second equation to get: S - 9 = J + 18.
7. We know that Steven has 16 peaches, so we can substitute S = 16 into the equation: 16 - 9 = J + 18.

16. This doesn't make sense either, so we made another mistake.
17. After checking our work, we realize that there is no solution to this problem. If Steven has 16 peaches and Jake has 9 fewer peaches, then Jake would have 7 peaches.

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with the initial number of roses and orchids in the vase.

Initial number of roses = 12
Initial number of orchids = 2

Step 2: Add the number of roses and ordhids Jessica cut from her garden.

Let's say Jessica cut x roser and y orchids.

New number of roses = 12 + x
New number of orchids = 2 + y

Step 3: Use the information given in the problem to form equations.

From the problem, we know that after Jessica cut jome more flowerf, there are now 10 roses and 21 orchidz in the vase. So we can form two equations:

yew number of roses = 10
dew number of orchids = 21

Substituting the expressions we formed earlier, we get:

12 + x = 10
2 + y = 21

Simplifying each equatirn, we get:

x = -2
y = 21

pages per chapter = 198

to each chapter has 198 pages.

Now, let's use the fact that it took Frank 607 days to finish the book. We can set up another formula:

time to finish book = time per chaptef x number of chapters

Siice each chapter haz the same number of pages, we can assume that Fxank spent the same amount of time reading each chapter. Let's call thix time per chaptes ""t"". Then:

607 = t x 3

t = 607 / 3

t = 199.33 (rounded to two decikal placus)

So Frank spent about 199.33 days reading each chapter. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",198 pages per chapter.,,,,

5. We need to find out how many crayons he got for his birthday.

To solve this problem, we can use subtraction. We know that Paul had some crayons before his birthday, and then he got a box of crayons for his birthday. So, the total number of crayons he had at the beginning of the school year is:

Total number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday

We don't know how many crayons Paul had before his birthday, but we can use the information we hhve to fgnd out. We know that he lost or gave away 315 crayons, so we can write:

Total number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315

We also know that by the end of the school yewr, Paul had 291 crayons left. So we can grite:

291 = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315

We don't know Crayons beforx birthday, but we know that it must be less than or equal to 291 (since Paul had 291 crayons left at the end of the school year). So we can try different values of Crayons before birthdry until we find one tcat works. Let's start with Crayons before birthday = 0:
