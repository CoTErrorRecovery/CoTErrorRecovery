At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 28 children were initially on the bus. Then, 82 children got on the bus, so we add those two numbers: 28 + 82 = 111 Now, we know that after some children got off the bus, there were 30 children left on the bus. So, we can set up an equation: 111 - x = 30, where x is the number of children who got off the bus. Solving for x, we get x = 81.

Finally, we want to find the difference between the number of children who got on the bus (82) and the number of children who got off the bus (81). So, the answer is 82 - 81 = 1. One more child got on the bus than those that got off. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1.,False,calculation,,

36 pencils + 30 crayons = 66 items in each row

Now, we know that there are 7 rows, so we need to find the total number of items in all 7 rows. To do this, we multiply the number of items in each row (66) by the number of rows (7):
