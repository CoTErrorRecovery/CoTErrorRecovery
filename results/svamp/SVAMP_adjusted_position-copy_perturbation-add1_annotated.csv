"Q: 28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 28 children were initially on the bus. Then, 82 children got on the bus, so we add those two numbers: 28 + 82 = 110 children.

However, we also know that some children got off the bus, and there were 30 children left on the bus. So, we can write an equation: 110 - x = 30, where x is the number of children who got off the bus.

Now, we can solve for x: 110 - x = 30 => x = 110 - 30 => x = 80 children got off the bus.

Finally, we need to find how many more children got on the bus than those that got off. We already know that 82 children got on the bus, so we subtract the number of children who got off the bus: 82 - 80 = 2.

"Q: Zachary did 15 push-ups in gym class today. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. John did 9 push-ups less than David. How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many push-ups David did. Since he did 39 more than Zachary, we can write the equation: 

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 39

Now we know that Zachary did 15 push-ups, so we can plug that into the equation:

David's push-ups = 15 + 39

David's push-ups = 54

Now we need to find out how many push-ups John did. Since he did 9 less than David, we can write the equation:

John's push-ups = David's push-ups - 9

We know that David did 54 push-ups, so we can plug that into the equation:

John's push-ups = 54 - 9

John's push-ups = 45

Now we can find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John. We can write the equation:

More push-ups = Zachary's push-ups - John's push-ups

We know that Zachary did 15 push-ups and John did 45 push-ups, so we can plug those numbers into the equation:

More push-ups = 15 - 45

"Q: Danny collects bottle caps. He found 36 bottle caps at the park while he threw away 35 old ones. Now he has 22 bottle caps in his collection. How many more bottle caps did danny find at the park than those he threw away?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found the new ones and threw away the old ones. Since he now has 22 bottle caps, and he found 36 new ones, we can write the equation:

Initial bottle caps + New bottle caps - Old bottle caps = Current bottle caps
