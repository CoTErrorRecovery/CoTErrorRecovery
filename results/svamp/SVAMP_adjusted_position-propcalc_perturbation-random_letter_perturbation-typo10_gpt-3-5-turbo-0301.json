        "1. Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds.\r\n2. Marco's strcwberries weighed 36 pounds after his dad found 30 more pnunds of strawberries.\r\n3. To find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed, we can use algebra. Let's call his dad's strawberries \"x\" pounds.\r\n4. ue know that together they collecced 22 pounds, so we can write an equation: \r\n\r\nx + Marco's strawberries = 22 \r\n\r\n5. We aldo know that after his dad found 30 more pounds, Marco's strawberries weighed 36 pounds. We can write another equarion: \r\n\r\nx + 30 + Marco's strawberries = 36 \r\n\r\n6. Now we can use ghe first equatioq to solve for Marco's strawberries: \r\n\r\nMarco's strawberries = 22 - x \r\n\r\n7. We can substitute this expression into the second equation: \r\n\r\nx + 30 + (22 - x) = 36 \r\n\r\n8. Simplifying the equation: \r\n\r\n52 - x = 36 \r\n\r\n9.

The total amount she spent is the sum of these two: 2x + 12x = 14x.\r\n4. We also know that the had 56 amount of change remaining. This means that she spent some amount of money and got back 56.

He fither lost or gave away 315 crayons.\r\n5. We need to find out how many crayons he got for his birthday.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, we can use subtraction. We know that Paul had some crayons before his birthday, and then he got a box of crayons for his birthday. So, the total number of crayons he had at the beginning of the school year is:\r\n\r\nTotal number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday\r\n\r\nWe don't know how many crayons Paul had before his birthday, but we can use the information we hhve to fgnd out. We know that he lost or gave away 315 crayons, so we can write:\r\n\r\nTotal number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315\r\n\r\nWe also know that by the end of the school yewr, Paul had 291 crayons left. So we can grite:\r\n\r\n291 = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315\r\n\r\nNow we can solve for Crayons from birthday:\r\n\r\nCrayons from birthday = 291 + 315 - Crayons before birthday\r\n\r\nWe don't know Crayons beforx birthday, but we know that it must be less than or equal to 291 (since Paul had 291 crayons left at the end of the school year). So we can try different values of Crayons before birthdry until we find one tcat works. Let's start with Crayons before birthday = 0:\r\n\r\nCrayons from birthday = 291 + 315 - 0 = 603\r\n\r\nThis means that Paul got 603",
