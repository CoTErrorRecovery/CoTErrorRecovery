First, we know that 28 children were initially on the bus. Then, 82 children got on the bus, so we add those two numbers: 28 + 82 = 110. Now, we know that there were 30 children on the bus after some got off. So, we can write an equation: 110 - x = 30, where x is the number of children who got off the bus. Solving for x, we get x = 80. So, 80 children got off the bus. Now, we want to find how many more children got on the bus than those that got off. We can subtract the number of children who got off from the number of children who got on: 82 - 80 = 2. Therefore, 2 more children got on the bus than those that got off.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many games Kelly needs to have in total to have 140 games left. To do this, we can use the equation:

Total games = Current games + Games to buy

We know that Kelly currently has 22 games, so we can plug that into the equation:

Total games = 22 + Games to buy

Now, we need to find out how many games Kelly needs to buy so that she will have 140 games left. To do this, we can use the equation:

Games left = Total games - Games to buy

We know that Kelly wants to have 140 games left, so we can plug that into the equation:

140 = Total games - Games to buy

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for the number of games Kelly needs to buy:

140 = (22 + Games to buy) - Games to buy

Now, we can solve for the number of games Kelly needs to buy:

"Q: A waiter had 11 customers. After some left he still had 3 customers. How many more customers left than those that stayed behind?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the waiter had 11 customers and some left. Let's call the number of customers who left L. So, we can write the equation:

11 - L = 3

Now, we need to find L. To do this, we can add L to both sides of the equation:

11 - L + L = 3 + L

This simplifies to:

11 = 3 + L

Now, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

11 - 3 = 3 + L - 3

This simplifies to:

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of Jesse's room. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Area = length × width

So, the area of Jesse's room is:

Area = 2 feet × 12 feet = 125 I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Let's recalculate the area of Jesse's room:

Area = 2 feet × 12 feet = 24 square feet

Now, since each tile is 4 square feet, we can find out how many tiles are needed by dividing the total area by the area of each tile:

Number of tiles = Total area / Area of each tile
Number of tiles = 24 square feet / 4 square feet/tile = 6 tiles

Jesse needs 6 tiles to cover the whole floor. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6.,True,calculation,explicitly identifies error,

"Q: Rachel had to complete 4 pages of reading homework, 7 pages of math homework and 19 more pages of biology homework. How many more pages of math homework than reading homework did she have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pages of biology homework Rachel had. We know she had 19 more pages of biology homework than the total of her reading and math homework. So, we add the number of pages of reading and math homework: 4 pages (reading) + 7 pages (math) = <<4+7=11>>11 pages.

"Q: Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together and colors to paint them. He needs a total of 57 g of colors to paint them. He needs 22 g of wax more. If the feathers require a total of 353 g of wax How many grams of wax does he already have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that he needs 22 g more wax than he currently has. So, let's represent the amount of wax he already has as x. Then, x + 22 g is the total amount of wax he needs, which is 353 g.

Now, we can write the equation: x + 22 = 353

To solve for x, we can subtract 22 from both sides of the equation: x = 353 - 22
