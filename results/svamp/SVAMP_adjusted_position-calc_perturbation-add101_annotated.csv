Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 28 children were initially on the bus. Then, 82 children got on the bus, so we add those two numbers: 28 + 82 = 211 A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 28 children were initially on the bus. Then, 82 children got on the bus, so we add those two numbers: 28 + 82 = 110. Now, we know that there were 30 children on the bus after some got off. So, we can write an equation: 110 - x = 30, where x is the number of children who got off the bus. Solving for x, we get x = 80. So, 80 children got off the bus. Now, we want to find how many more children got on the bus than those that got off. We can subtract the number of children who got off from the number of children who got on: 82 - 80 = 2. Therefore, 2 more children got on the bus than those that got off.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many games Kelly needs to have in total to have 140 games left. To do this, we can use the equation:

Total games = Current games + Games to buy

We know that Kelly currently has 22 games, so we can plug that into the equation:

Total games = 22 + Games to buy

Now, we need to find out how many games Kelly needs to buy so that she will have 140 games left. To do this, we can use the equation:

Games left = Total games - Games to buy

We know that Kelly wants to have 140 games left, so we can plug that into the equation:

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the waiter had 11 customers and some left. Let's call the number of customers who left L. So, we can write the equation:

11 - L = 3

Now, we need to find L. To do this, we can add L to both sides of the equation:

11 - L + L = 3 + L

This simplifies to:

11 = 3 + L

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's use the information that Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. Let A be the number of apples Adam has and J be the number of apples Jackie has. So, A = J + 8.

Next, we know that together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. So, A + J = 12.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to find the number of apples Jackie has: (J + 8) + J = 12. This simplifies to 2J + 8 = 12.

To solve for J, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 2J = 4. Then, we can divide both sides by 2 to find that J = 2.

Now that we know Jackie has 2 apples, we can use the first equation to find the number of apples Adam has: A = 2 + 8 = 10.

He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's use the information that Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. Let A be the number of apples Adam has and J be the number of apples Jackie has. So, A = J + 8.

Next, we know that together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. So, A + J = 12.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to find the number of apples Jackie has: (J + 8) + J = 12. This simplifies to 2J + 8 = 12.

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Understand the given information:
   * Marco and his dad collected a total of 36 pounds of strawberries.
   * On the way back, Marco's dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries.
   * After losing the strawberries, Marco's strawberries weigh 12 pounds.

2. Find out how much Marco's strawberries weighed initially:
   * We already know that after losing the strawberries, Marco's strawberries weigh 12 pounds.
   * So, Marco's initial strawberry weight was also 12 pounds.

3. Calculate the initial weight of Marco's dad's strawberries:
   * Total weight of strawberries = Marco's strawberries + Dad's strawberries
   * 36 pounds = 12 pounds + Dad's strawberries
   * Dad's strawberries = 36 pounds - 12 pounds
   * Dad's strawberries = 125  pounds

4. Calculate the final weight of Marco's dad's strawberries:
   * Dad's final strawberries = Dad's initial strawberries - Lost strawberries
   * Dad's final strawberries = 125 pounds - 8 pounds
   * Dad's final strawberries = 16 pounds

Therefore, after losing 8 pounds of strawberries, Marco's dad's strawberries now weigh 16 pounds. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is", 16.,calculation,True,other complete hallucination,

3. We know the number of girls is 697. So, we can write an equation:
   * 697 = Number of boys + 228

4. To find the number of boys, we need to subtract 228 from both sides of the equation:

   * Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries on the way back.
   * After losing the strawberries, Marco's remaining strawberries weigh 3 pounds.

2. Find out how much Marco's strawberries weighed before he lost some:
   * Marco's initial strawberries = Marco's remaining strawberries + Lost strawberries
   * Marco's initial strawberries = 3 pounds + 9 pounds
   * Marco's initial strawberries = 113  pounds

3. Calculate the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries:
   * Total strawberries = Marco's initial strawberries + Dad's strawberries
   * 24 pounds = 12 pounds + Dad's strawberries
   * Dad's strawberries = 24 pounds - 12 pounds
   * Dad's strawberries = 12 pounds

Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries weigh 12 pounds. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is", 12.,calculation,True,other complete hallucination,

A: Let's think step by step. 1) First, let's find out how much each book costs. We know that Edward spent $16 on 92 books, and each book costs the same amount. So, we can divide the total amount spent by the number of books to get the price of each book.

   Price of each book = Total amount spent รท Number of books

   But since we can't have a fraction of a cent, let's round this to the nearest cent, which is $0.17.

2) Now that we know the price of each book, we can calculate the total amount Edward spent on the books.

   Total amount spent = Price of each book ร Number of books
                      = $0.17 ร 92

3) After buying the books, Edward has $6 left. To find out how much he had before, we need to add the amount he has left to the amount he spent.

   Amount before spending = Amount left + Amount spent
                          = $6 + $15.64

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many games Kelly needs to have in total to have 140 games left. To do this, we can use the equation:

Total games = Current games + Games to buy

We know that Kelly currently has 22 games, so we can plug that into the equation:

Total games = 22 + Games to buy

Now, we need to find out how many games Kelly needs to buy so that she will have 140 games left. To do this, we can use the equation:

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for the number of games Kelly needs to buy:

140 = (22 + Games to buy) - Games to buy

Now, we can solve for the number of games Kelly needs to buy:

David's push-ups = 15 + 39

David's push-ups = 54

Now we need to find out how many push-ups John did. Since he did 9 less than David, we can write the equation:

John's push-ups = David's push-ups - 9

We know that David did 54 push-ups, so we can plug that into the equation:

John's push-ups = 54 - 9

John's push-ups = 45

Now we can find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John. We can write the equation:

More push-ups = Zachary's push-ups - John's push-ups

We know that Zachary did 15 push-ups and John did 45 push-ups, so we can plug those numbers into the equation:

More push-ups = 15 - 45

More push-ups = -131 A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many push-ups David did. Since he did 39 more than Zachary, we can write the equation:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 39

Now we know that Zachary did 15 push-ups, so we can plug that into the equation:

David's push-ups = 15 + 39

David's push-ups = 54

Now we need to find out how many push-ups John did. Since he did 9 less than David, we can write the equation:

John's push-ups = David's push-ups - 9

We know that David did 54 push-ups, so we can plug that into the equation:

John's push-ups = 54 - 9

John's push-ups = 45

Now we can find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John. We can write the equation:

More push-ups = Zachary's push-ups - John's push-ups

We know that Zachary did 15 push-ups and John did 45 push-ups, so we can plug those numbers into the equation:

More push-ups = 15 - 45

More push-ups = -30

So, Zachary did 30 fewer push-ups than John. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",-30.,calculation,False,,
