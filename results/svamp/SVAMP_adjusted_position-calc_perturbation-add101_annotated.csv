Total games = Current games + Games to buy

We know that Kelly currently has 22 games, so we can plug that into the equation:

Total games = 22 + Games to buy

Now, we need to find out how many games Kelly needs to buy so that she will have 140 games left. To do this, we can use the equation:

He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's use the information that Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. Let A be the number of apples Adam has and J be the number of apples Jackie has. So, A = J + 8.

Next, we know that together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. So, A + J = 12.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to find the number of apples Jackie has: (J + 8) + J = 12. This simplifies to 2J + 8 = 12.

To solve for J, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 2J = 4. Then, we can divide both sides by 2 to find that J = 2.

Now that we know Jackie has 2 apples, we can use the first equation to find the number of apples Adam has: A = 2 + 8 = 10.

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Understand the given information:
   * Marco and his dad went strawberry picking.
   * Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds.
   * Together, their strawberries weighed 37 pounds.

2. We need to find out how much Marco's dad's strawberries weighed. Let's call this weight 'x'.

A: Let's think step by step. 1) First, let's find out how much each book costs. We know that Edward spent $16 on 92 books, and each book costs the same amount. So, we can divide the total amount spent by the number of books to get the price of each book.

   Price of each book = Total amount spent ÷ Number of books
                      = $16 ÷ 92
                      = $101.174",22.0,sbs,"Q: Edward spent $ 16 to buy 92 books each book costing him the same amount of money. Now he has $ 6. How much did Edward have before he spent his money?

                      = $101.174 

   But since we can't have a fraction of a cent, let's round this to the nearest cent, which is $0.17.

2) Now that we know the price of each book, we can calculate the total amount Edward spent on the books.

   Total amount spent = Price of each book × Number of books
                      = $0.17 × 92
                      = $15.64

3) After buying the books, Edward has $6 left. To find out how much he had before, we need to add the amount he has left to the amount he spent.

   Amount before spending = Amount left + Amount spent
                          = $6 + $15.64

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many games Kelly needs to have in total to have 140 games left. To do this, we can use the equation:

Total games = Current games + Games to buy

We know that Kelly currently has 22 games, so we can plug that into the equation:

Total games = 22 + Games to buy

Now, we need to find out how many games Kelly needs to buy so that she will have 140 games left. To do this, we can use the equation:

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for the number of games Kelly needs to buy:

140 = (22 + Games to buy) - Games to buy

Now, we can solve for the number of games Kelly needs to buy:

John's push-ups = David's push-ups - 9

We know that David did 54 push-ups, so we can plug that into the equation:

John's push-ups = 54 - 9

John's push-ups = 45

Now we can find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John. We can write the equation:

More push-ups = Zachary's push-ups - John's push-ups

We know that Zachary did 15 push-ups and John did 45 push-ups, so we can plug those numbers into the equation:

More push-ups = 15 - 45

More push-ups = -30

So, Zachary did 30 fewer push-ups than John. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",-30.,calculation,False,,
