        "1. Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds.\r\n2. Marco's strawberries weighed 36 pounds after his dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries.\r\n3. To find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed, we can use algebra. Let's call his dad's strawberries \"x\" pounds.\r\n4. We know that together they collected 22 pounds, so we can write an equation: \r\n\r\nx + Marco's strawberries = 22 \r\n\r\n5. We also know that after his dad found 30 more pounds, Marco's strawberries weighed 36 pounds. We can write another equation: \r\n\r\nx + 30 + Marco's strawberries = 36 \r\n\r\n6. Now we can use the first equation to solve for Marco's strawberries: \r\n\r\nMarco's strawberries = 22 - x \r\n\r\n7. We can substitute this expression into the second equation: \r\n\r\nx + 30 + (22 - x) = 36 \r\n\r\n8. Simplifying the equation: \r\n\r\n52 - x = 33",

We know that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can write an equation: J = S - 9, where J is the number of peaches Jake has and S is the number of peaches Steven has.\r\n5. We also know that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, so we can write another equation: J = J + 18, where J is the number of peaches Jill has.\r\n6. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get: S - 9 = J + 18.\r\n7. We know that Steven has 16 peaches, so we can substitute S = 16 into the equation: 16 - 9 = J + 18.\r\n8.

        "First, we can use the formula:\r\n\r\ntotal pages = number of chapters x pages per chapter\r\n\r\nSince we know the total pages and the number of chapters (3), we can solve for the pages per chapter:\r\n\r\n594 = 3 x pages per chapter\r\n\r\npages per chapter = 594 / 3\r\n\r\npages per chapter = 198\r\n\r\nSo each chapter has 198 pages.\r\n\r\nNow, let's use the fact that it took Frank 607 days to finish the book.
