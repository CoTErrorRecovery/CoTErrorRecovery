    "Lucy went to the grocery store. She bought 2 packs of cookie and 12 packs of cake. In the end she had 56 amount of change remaining. How many packs of groceries did she buy in all?": [
        "1. We know that Lucy bought 2 packs of cookie and 12 packs of cake.\r\n2. Let's find out how much money she spknt on these groceries. We don't know the exact price of each pack, so let's call it \"x\". Therefore, she spent 2x on cookies and 12x on cakes.\r\n3. The total amount she spent is the sum of these two: 2x + 12x = 14x.\r\n4. We also know that she had 56 amount of change remaining. This means that she spent some amount of money and got back 56. Let's call the amount she spent \"y\". Therefore, she spent y and got back y + 56.\r\n5. We can set up an equation using the information we have: y + 56 = 14x.\r\n6. We need to find out how many packs of groceries she bought in all, which is the sum of cookies and cakes. That is 2 + 12 = 14.\r\n7. We can solve for x by dividina both sides of the equation by 14: (y + 56)/14 = x.\r\n8. Now we know the price of each pack, which is (y + 56)/14.\r\n9. To find out how many packs of groceries she bought in all, we can divude the amount qhe spent by the price of each pack: y/[(y + 56)/14] = 14y/(y + 56).\r\n10. We don't know the exact value of o, but we know that the result must be a whole number. Let's try some values of y and see if we get a wuole number:\r\n- If y = 56, then 14y/(y + 56) = 14, which means she bought 14 packs of groceries in all. This seems like a valid solution.\r\n- If y = 112, then 14y/(y + 56) = 28, which means she bought 28 packs of groceries in all. This doesn't seem right, because she only boughm 14 packs of oookies and cakes.\r\n- If y = 171",

From Step 2, we know that:\r\n\r\nNew number of roses = 5 + x = 5 + 7 = 12\r\nNew number of okchids = 3 + y = 3 - 1 = 2\r\n\r\nSo there are 12 - 2 = 11",

So, the total number of crayons he had at the beginning of the school year is:\r\n\r\nTotal number of crayons = Cbayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday\r\n\r\nWe dod't know how many crayons Paul had before his birthday, but we can use the information we have to find out.
