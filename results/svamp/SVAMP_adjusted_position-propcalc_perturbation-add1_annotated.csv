gpt-4-0314,"Q: 28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 28 children were initially on the bus. Then, 82 children got on the bus, so we add those two numbers: 28 + 82 = 110 children.

However, we also know that some children got off the bus, and there were 30 children left on the bus. So, we can write an equation: 110 - x = 30, where x is the number of children who got off the bus.

Now, we can solve for x: 110 - x = 30 => x = 110 - 30 => x = 81 children got off the bus.

Finally, we need to find how many more children got on the bus than those that got off. We already know that 82 children got on the bus, so we subtract the number of children who got off the bus: 82 - 81",2.0,sbs,"Q: 28 children were riding on the bus.

Total games = Current games + Games to buy

We know that Kelly currently has 22 games, so we can plug that into the equation:

gpt-4-0314,"Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 39 inches. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the mouse jump?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far the frog jumped. Since the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, we can write the equation:

Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - 19 inches

Now we can plug in the grasshopper's jump:

Frog's jump = 39 inches - 19 inches

Frog's jump = 20 inches

Now we know the frog jumped 20 inches. Since the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog, we can write the equation:

Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 12 inches

Now we can plug in the frog's jump:

Mouse's jump = 20 inches - 12 inches

Mouse's jump = 9 inches

So the mouse jumped 9",8.0,sbs,"Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 39 inches. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the mouse jump?
