Together they collected strawberries that weighed 36 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed 36 pounds.
2. On the way back, his dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries.
3. Marco's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds.
4. We need to find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed now.

To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's call the weight of his dad's strawberries ""x"". Then we can set up an equation:

x + 12 = 36 - 8

The left side of the equation represents the total weight of strawberries after his dad lost 8 pounds and Marco's strawberries weighed 12 pounds. The right side of the equation represents the original weight of all the strawberries they collected, minus the 8 pounds his dad lost.

Now we can simplify and solve for x:

In a school there are 697 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 228 more girls than boys How many boys are there in that school?,469.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: In a school there are 697 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 228 more girls than boys How many boys are there in that school?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that there are 697 girls in the school.
2. We also know that there are 228 more girls than boys.
3. Let's use ""x"" to represent the number of boys in the school.
4. According to step 2, the number of girls is x + 228.
5. We know that the total number of students in the school is the sum of the number of girls and the number of boys. Therefore, we can write an equation: 

x + (x + 228) = total number of students

6. We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: 

2x + 228 = total number of students

7. We don't know the total number of students, but we don't need to know it to solve for x. We just need to use the information we have to isolate x. 

8. Let's start by subtracting 228 from both sides of the equation: 

2x = total number of students - 228

9. Now we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for x: 

x = (total number of students - 228) / 2

10. We still don't know the total number of students, but we can use the fact that there are 697 girls to find it. 

11. We know that the total number of students is the sum of the number of girls and the number of boys: 

total number of students = 697 + x

12. We can substitute the expression we found for x in step 9: 

total number of students = 697 + (total number of students - 228) / 2

13. Now we can solve for the total number of students: 

2(total number of students) = 1394 + total number of students - 228

14. Simplifying this equation: 

total number of students = 1163

15. Finally, we can use this value to find the number of boys: 

x = (total number of students - 228) / 2 = (1163 - 228) / 2 = 467

Therefore, there are 467 boys in the school. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",467,False,False

How many girls are there in the school now?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we add the initial number of girls and boys: 

732 + 761 = 1493 

Next, we add the number of new girls and boys: 

682 + 8 = 690 

Now, we add the two totals to get the new total number of students: 

1493 + 690 = 2183 

Finally, we subtract the initial number of boys from the new total to get the new number of girls: 

2183 - 769 = 1414 

Therefore, there are 1414 girls in the school now. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1414,False,False

450 + 38 = 488 

Now, we need to find out how many students did not suggest either mashed potatoes or bacon. 

We know that there were a total of 66 choices, and we already accounted for 2 of them (mashed potatoes and bacon). 

So the number of choices that were not suggested is: 

66 - 2 = 64 

Therefore, the number of students who did not participate in suggesting new food items is: 

64 - 488 = -424 

Wait a minute, that doesn't make sense! A negative number of students? 

This means that there must be an error in the problem statement. Perhaps the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes was supposed to be 350 instead of 450. 

Let's assume that's the case. 

Then the total number of students who suggested either mashed potatoes or bacon is: 

350 + 38 = 388 

And the number of students who did not participate is: 

64 - 388 = -324 

Still a negative number. 

Let's try another assumption. Perhaps the total number of choices was supposed to be 76 instead of 66. 

Then the number of choices that were not suggested is: 

76 - 2 = 74 

And the number of students who did not participate is: 

74 - 488 = -414 

Another negative number. 

At this point, we can conclude that there is no way to solve this problem with the given information. We need to know either the total number of students who participated or the percentage of students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",not possible to determine.,False,False

There were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. How many roses did she cut?,2.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: There were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. How many roses did she cut?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the difference in the number of roses and orchids between the two situations.

In the first situation, there were 15 roses and 62 orchids, so the total number of flowers in the vase was:

15 + 62 = 77

In the second situation, there are 17 roses and 96 orchids, so the total number of flowers in the vase is:

17 + 96 = 113

The difference between these two situations is:

113 - 77 = 36

Step 2: Determine how many of the additional flowers are roses.

We know that Jessica added some more roses and orchids to the vase. Let's say she added r roses and o orchids. Then we can write:

r + o = 36

But we don't know how many of the additional flowers are roses and how many are orchids. However, we do know that the total number of roses in the vase increased by:

17 - 15 = 2

So Jessica must have added 2 more roses to the vase. Therefore, we can write:

r = 2

Step 3: Solve for the number of orchids Jessica added.

We can use the equation we wrote in step 2 to solve for o:

r + o = 36

2 + o = 36

o = 36 - 2

o = 34

Therefore, Jessica added 2 more roses and 34 more orchids to the vase. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",Jessica cut 13 roses.,False,False

Later he added some more action figures to the shelf and removed 10 of the old ones. If there are 8 action figures on his shelf now How many action figures did he add to the shelf?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Jerry had 7 action figures on the shelf.
2. He added some more action figures to the shelf.
3. He removed 10 of the old ones.
4. Now there are 8 action figures on the shelf.

To find out how many action figures Jerry added to the shelf, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know that after removing 10 old action figures, there were still some left on the shelf. So, we can say:

8 (current number of action figures) + 10 (old ones removed) = total number of action figures before removal

This gives us:

18 = total number of action figures before removal

Next, we know that Jerry started with 7 action figures before adding any more. So, we can say:

total number of action figures before removal - 7 (original ones) = number of action figures added

This gives us:

18 - 7 = 11

Therefore, Jerry added 11 more action figures to the shelf. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",11,False,False
Julia played tag with 12 kids on monday. She played tag with 14 kids on tuesday. She spent a total of 34 hours to play tag on both days. How many kids did she play with altogether?,26.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Julia played tag with 12 kids on monday. She played tag with 14 kids on tuesday. She spent a total of 34 hours to play tag on both days. How many kids did she play with altogether?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Julia played tag with 12 kids on Monday and 14 kids on Tuesday, so she played with a total of 12 + 14 = 26 kids.
2. We know that she spent a total of 34 hours playing tag on both days. Let's call the time she spent playing tag on Monday ""x"" and the time she spent playing tag on Tuesday ""y"". So we have:
x + y = 34
3. We don't know the exact values of x and y, but we can use another piece of information to find them. We know that Julia played with 12 kids on Monday and 14 kids on Tuesday, so the total number of kids she played with is the sum of the number of kids she played with on each day. In other words:
12x + 14y = total number of kids she played with
4. We already know that the total number of kids she played with is 26, so we can substitute that into the equation above:
12x + 14y = 26
5. Now we have two equations with two unknowns:
x + y = 34
12x + 14y = 26
6. We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can solve for x:
x = 34 - y
7. Now we can substitute this expression for x into the second equation:
12(34 - y) + 14y = 26
8. Simplifying this equation, we get:
408 - 12y + 14y = 26
2y = -382
y = -191
9. This doesn't make sense, since we can't have negative time. We made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back to step 6 and solve for y instead:
y = 34 - x
10. Now we can substitute this expression for y into the second equation:
12x + 14(34 - x) = 26
11. Simplifying this equation, we get:
12x + 476 - 14x = 26
-2x = -450
x = 225
12. Now we can use either equation to solve for y:
y = 34 - x = 34 - 225 = -191
13. Again, this doesn't make sense. We made another mistake somewhere. Let's go Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",not possible to determine.,False,False

How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?,266.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Nell collects cards. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards.
2. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so let's say she gave x baseball cards and y Ace cards.
3. After giving some cards to Jeff, Nell has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. So we can write an equation: 

309 - x + 356 - y = 415 

4. We want to find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has. So we need to subtract the number of Ace cards from the number of baseball cards: 

415 - 356 = 59 

5. To solve for x and y, we can simplify the equation we wrote in step 3: 

665 - x - y = 415 

6. Subtract 665 from both sides: 

-x - y = -250 

7. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other: 

x = -y + 250 

8. Now we can substitute this expression for x into the equation in step 3: 

309 - (-y + 250) + 356 - y = 415 

9. Simplify: 

-y + 250 - y = 415 - 309 - 356 

-2y + 250 = -50 

10. Solve for y: 

y = 150 

11. Now we can use this value of y to find x: 

x = -y + 250 = -150 + 250 = 100 

12. Finally, we can check our answer by verifying that Nell has 59 more baseball cards than Ace cards: 

415 - 356 = 59 

So Nell has 59 more baseball cards than Ace cards. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",59,False,False

You had 26 bags with equal number of cookies. If you had 15 candies and 52 cookies in total How many cookies does each bag have?,2.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: You had 26 bags with equal number of cookies. If you had 15 candies and 52 cookies in total How many cookies does each bag have?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that there are 26 bags with equal number of cookies, so let's call the number of cookies in each bag ""x"".
2. Therefore, the total number of cookies in all 26 bags is 26x.
3. We also know that there are 52 cookies in total, so we can set up an equation: 26x + 15 = 52.
4. Solving for x, we can subtract 15 from both sides: 26x = 37.
5. Finally, we can divide both sides by 26 to get x = 1.42 (rounded to two decimal places).
6. Therefore, each bag has approximately 1.42 cookies. However, since we can't have a fraction of a cookie, we can say that each bag has either 1 or 2 cookies, depending on how we round the number. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",either 1 or 2 cookies per bag.,False,False

There were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. How many orchids did she cut?,4.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: There were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. How many orchids did she cut?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with the initial number of roses and orchids in the vase.

Initial number of roses = 16
Initial number of orchids = 3

Step 2: Add the number of roses and orchids Jessica cut from her garden.

Let's say Jessica cut x number of roses and y number of orchids.

New number of roses = 16 + x
New number of orchids = 3 + y

Step 3: Use the information given in the problem to form an equation.

According to the problem, there are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. So we can write:

New number of orchids = 7
New number of roses = 13

Step 4: Solve for x and y.

From Step 2, we know:

New number of roses = 16 + x
New number of orchids = 3 + y

Substituting the values from Step 3, we get:

7 = 3 + y
13 = 16 + x

Solving for y, we get:

y = 4

Solving for x, we get:

x = -3

Step 5: Check the answer.

We can check our answer by verifying that the new number of roses and orchids in the vase add up to the total number of flowers Jessica cut from her garden.

New number of roses = 16 + x = 16 - 3 = 13
New number of orchids = 3 + y = 3 + 4 = 7

Total number of flowers Jessica cut = x + y = -3 + 4 = 1

13 + 7 = 20
20 + 1 = 21

The total number of flowers Jessica cut from her garden is not equal to the sum of the new number of roses and orchids in the vase. This means our answer is incorrect.

Step 6: Correct the answer.

Since the total number of flowers Jessica cut is not equal to the sum of the new number of roses and orchids in the vase, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back to Step 4 and check our work.

7 = 3 + y
13 = 16 + x

Solving for y, we get:

y = 4

Solving for x, we get:

x = -3

We made a mistake in solving for x. The correct value Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",":

Jessica cut 4 orchids.",False,True

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that Marco and his dad's strawberries together weighed 4 pounds.
2. We also know that Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds.
3. To find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's, we need to subtract his dad's strawberries from the total weight of their strawberries.
4. We can set up an equation: 

    Marco's strawberries - Dad's strawberries = Difference

    19 - Dad's strawberries = Difference

5. We can simplify this equation by subtracting 19 from both sides:

    -Dad's strawberries = Difference - 19

6. We can simplify further by multiplying both sides by -1 to get rid of the negative sign:

    Dad's strawberries = 19 - Difference

7. Now we can substitute this equation into the original equation:

    Marco's strawberries - (19 - Difference) = Difference

8. We can simplify this equation by distributing the negative sign:

    Marco's strawberries - 19 + Difference = Difference

9. We can simplify further by adding 19 to both sides:

    Marco's strawberries + Difference = 2 * Difference

10. We can simplify even further by subtracting Marco's strawberries from both sides:

    Difference = 19 - Marco's strawberries

11. Now we can substitute in the value we know for Marco's strawberries:

    Difference = 19 - 19 = 0

12. Therefore, Marco's strawberries weighed the same as his dad's strawberries, and the difference is 0. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",0,False,False

"Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework, 7 pages of reading homework and 3 more pages of biology homework. How many pages of math and biology homework did she have to complete?",11.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework, 7 pages of reading homework and 3 more pages of biology homework. How many pages of math and biology homework did she have to complete?

A: Let's think step by step. Rachel had to complete:
- 8 pages of math homework
- 7 pages of reading homework
- 3 more pages of biology homework

To find out how many pages of math and biology homework she had to complete, we need to add the number of pages of math homework and the number of pages of biology homework.

Math homework: 8 pages
Biology homework: 3 more pages than the original amount, so we add 3 to the original amount of biology homework.

Original amount of biology homework + 3 = Total amount of biology homework

We don't know the original amount of biology homework, but we know that Rachel had to complete a total of 8 + 7 + (original amount of biology homework + 3) pages of homework.

So, we can write an equation:

8 + 7 + (original amount of biology homework + 3) = total amount of homework

Simplifying the equation:

18 + original amount of biology homework = total amount of homework

Now we need to isolate the original amount of biology homework:

original amount of biology homework = total amount of homework - 18

We don't know the total amount of homework, but we know that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework and some biology homework. So, we can write another equation:

total amount of homework = 8 + (original amount of biology homework + 3)

Substituting this into the previous equation:

original amount of biology homework = (8 + (original amount of biology homework + 3)) - 18

Simplifying:

original amount of biology homework = original amount of biology homework - 7

This equation doesn't make sense, because it says that the original amount of biology homework is equal to itself minus 7. So, we made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back to the beginning and try a different approach.

Rachel had to complete:
- 8 pages of math homework
- 7 pages of reading homework
- 3 more pages of biology homework

To find out how many pages of math and biology homework she had to complete, we can add the number of pages of math homework and the number of pages of biology homework:

Math homework: 8 pages
Biology homework: 3 more pages than the original amount

Let's call the original amount of biology homework ""x"". Then, the total amount of biology homework is ""x + 3"".

So, Rachel had to complete Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8 + (x + 3) = 11 + x pages of homework in math and biology.,False,False

There were 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase. How many orchids did she cut?,19.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: There were 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase. How many orchids did she cut?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with the initial number of roses and orchids in the vase.

Initial number of roses = 12
Initial number of orchids = 2

Step 2: Add the number of roses and orchids Jessica cut from her garden.

Let's say Jessica cut x roses and y orchids.

New number of roses = 12 + x
New number of orchids = 2 + y

Step 3: Use the information given in the problem to form equations.

From the problem, we know that after Jessica cut some more flowers, there are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase. So we can form two equations:

New number of roses = 10
New number of orchids = 21

Substituting the expressions we formed earlier, we get:

12 + x = 10
2 + y = 21

Simplifying each equation, we get:

x = -2
y = 19

Step 4: Check the answer.

It doesn't make sense for Jessica to have cut a negative number of roses, so we can ignore the first equation. However, it does make sense for her to have cut 19 orchids, since the initial number of orchids was only 2 and the final number is 21. Therefore, Jessica cut 19 orchids from her flower garden. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",19,False,True

Lucy went to the grocery store. She bought 2 packs of cookie and 12 packs of cake. In the end she had 56 amount of change remaining. How many packs of groceries did she buy in all?,14.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Lucy went to the grocery store. She bought 2 packs of cookie and 12 packs of cake. In the end she had 56 amount of change remaining. How many packs of groceries did she buy in all?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that Lucy bought 2 packs of cookie and 12 packs of cake.
2. Let's find out how much money she spent on these groceries. We don't know the exact price of each pack, so let's call it ""x"". Therefore, she spent 2x on cookies and 12x on cakes.
3. The total amount she spent is the sum of these two: 2x + 12x = 14x.
4. We also know that she had 56 amount of change remaining. This means that she spent some amount of money and got back 56. Let's call the amount she spent ""y"". Therefore, she spent y and got back y + 56.
5. We can set up an equation using the information we have: y + 56 = 14x.
6. We need to find out how many packs of groceries she bought in all, which is the sum of cookies and cakes. That is 2 + 12 = 14.
7. We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 14: (y + 56)/14 = x.
8. Now we know the price of each pack, which is (y + 56)/14.
9. To find out how many packs of groceries she bought in all, we can divide the amount she spent by the price of each pack: y/[(y + 56)/14] = 14y/(y + 56).
10. We don't know the exact value of y, but we know that the result must be a whole number. Let's try some values of y and see if we get a whole number:
- If y = 56, then 14y/(y + 56) = 14, which means she bought 14 packs of groceries in all. This seems like a valid solution.
- If y = 112, then 14y/(y + 56) = 28, which means she bought 28 packs of groceries in all. This doesn't seem right, because she only bought 14 packs of cookies and cakes.
- If y = 168, then 14y/(y + 56) = 42, which means she bought 42 packs of groceries in all. This also doesn't seem right.
- If y = 224, then 14y/(y + 56) = 56, which means Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",14. Lucy bought 14 packs of groceries in all.,False,True

After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add up the weight Jessie lost in the first and second week: 

62 kg + 140 kg = 202 kg 

Next, we need to subtract this amount from her current weight: 

9 kg - 202 kg = -193 kg

A: Let's think step by step. 1. First, we need to find out how many students can fit on one bus. Since there are 3 seats on each bus, we can divide the total number of students by 3: 

111 students ÷ 3 seats per bus = 37 buses 

2. However, we also need to consider how many classrooms there are in the school. If we assume that each classroom has an equal number of students, we can divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms: 

111 students ÷ 72 classrooms = 1.54 students per classroom 

This means that there may be some classrooms with only 1 or 2 students, which would not require a full bus. 

3. To be safe, we can round up to the nearest whole number of buses needed: 

37 buses rounded up = 38 buses 

Therefore, we would need 38 buses to transport all 111 students on the field trip. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",38,False,False

There were 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the day Rachel visited. We also know that there were 188 visitors the previous day. So in total, there were:

557 + 188 = 745 visitors in two days

Now, we need to figure out how many visitors came in 57 days. We can use proportions to solve this problem. If 745 visitors came in two days, then how many visitors would come in 57 days?

745 visitors / 2 days = x visitors / 57 days

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

745 * 57 = 2 * x

42,465 = 2x

x = 21,232.5

So approximately 21,233 visitors would come to the Buckingham palace in 57 days. However, since we can't have half a visitor, we should round this number to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we can say that about 21,233 visitors would come to the Buckingham palace in 57 days. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","21,233.00",False,False

Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 28 children were initially on the bus. Then, 82 children got on the bus, so we add those two numbers: 28 + 82 = 110 children.

However, we also know that some children got off the bus, and there were 30 children left on the bus. So, we can write an equation: 110 - x = 30, where x is the number of children who got off the bus.

Now, we can solve for x: 110 - x = 30 => x = 110 - 30 => x = 80 children got off the bus.

Finally, we need to find how many more children got on the bus than those that got off. We already know that 82 children got on the bus, so we subtract the number of children who got off the bus: 82 - 80 = 2.

So, 2 more children got on the bus than those that got off. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2,True,False

There, Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 246 visitors on that day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of visitors in those two days. We know that there were 703 visitors on the previous day and 246 visitors on that day. So, we can add these two numbers to find the total number of visitors in those two days:

703 (previous day) + 246 (that day) = 949 visitors (in two days)

Now, we need to find the average number of visitors per day. To do this, we can divide the total number of visitors in those two days by 2:

949 visitors (in two days) / 2 = 474.5 visitors per day (on average)

Finally, we need to find the total number of visitors within 25 days. To do this, we can multiply the average number of visitors per day by 25:

474.5 visitors per day (on average) * 25 days = 11,862.5 visitors

Since we cannot have a fraction of a visitor, we can round this number to the nearest whole number:

11,862.5 visitors ≈ 11,863 visitors

So, approximately 11,863 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 25 days. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",11863,False,False

If she spent 4 dollars. How much more money did she receive from her mom than she did from her dad?

A: Let's think step by step. First, Gwen received 5 dollars from her dad. Then, her mom gave her 7 more dollars. So, she had a total of 5 + 7 = <<5+7=12>>12 dollars.

After that, she spent 4 dollars. So, she had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 dollars left.

Now, we want to find out how much more money she received from her mom than from her dad. Since her mom gave her 7 dollars and her dad gave her 5 dollars, the difference is 7 - 5 = <<7-5=2>>2 dollars.

So, Gwen received 2 dollars more from her mom than from her dad. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2,True,False

Now he has 21 bottle caps and 52 wrappers in his collection. How many more bottle caps than wrappers did danny find at the park?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps and wrappers Danny had before he found the ones at the park. To do this, we can subtract the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park from the total number he has now.

For bottle caps:
Total number of bottle caps now = 21
Number of bottle caps found at the park = 50
So, the number of bottle caps he had before = 21 - 50 = -29

For wrappers:
Total number of wrappers now = 52
Number of wrappers found at the park = 46
So, the number of wrappers he had before = 52 - 46 = 6

Now, we can find the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park.

Difference = Number of bottle caps found at the park - Number of wrappers found at the park
Difference = 50 - 46 = 4

So, Danny found 4 more bottle caps than wrappers at the park. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4,False,False

She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many cards Nell had in total before giving some to Jeff. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards, so she had 309 + 356 = <<309+356=665>>665 cards.

Now, we know that she has 415 cards left after giving some to Jeff. So, she gave away 665 - 415 = <<665-415=250>>250 cards to Jeff.

Let's denote the number of baseball cards Nell has left as B and the number of Ace cards she has left as A. We know that B + A = 415.

We also know that Nell initially had 309 baseball cards, so she gave away 309 - B baseball cards to Jeff. Similarly, she initially had 356 Ace cards, so she gave away 356 - A Ace cards to Jeff.

Since the total number of cards given to Jeff is 250, we can write the equation (309 - B) + (356 - A) = 250.

Now, we have two equations with two variables:

1) B + A = 415
2) (309 - B) + (356 - A) = 250

Let's solve these equations simultaneously. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","From equation 1, we can write A = 415 - B. Now, let's substitute this expression for A in equation 2:

(309 - B) + (356 - (415 - B)) = 250

Now, let's simplify and solve for B:

309 - B + 356 - 415 + B = 250
B - B = 250 - 309 - 356 + 415
0 = -250
B = 309

Now that we have the value of B, let's find the value of A:

A = 415 - B
A = 415 - 309
A = 106

Now we can find the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has:

Difference = B - A
Difference = 309 - 106
Difference = 203

Nell has 203 more baseball cards than Ace cards.",False,False

She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar How many cups of flour did she put in?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Mary still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar. Let's represent the number of cups of sugar she still needs as x. Then the number of cups of flour she still needs is x + 2.

Now, we know that the recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar. So, the total amount of flour and sugar she still needs to put in is:

x + 2 (flour) + x (sugar) = 11 (flour) + 7 (sugar)

Combining the x terms, we get:

2x + 2 = 18

Now, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 16

Finally, we can divide both sides by 2 to find the value of x:

x = 8

So, Mary still needs to put in 8 cups of sugar. Since she needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, she still needs 10 cups of flour. Since the recipe calls for 11 cups of flour, she has already put in:

11 (total cups of flour) - 10 (cups of flour still needed) = 1 cup of flour. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Steven has 8 peaches and 12 apples.
2. Jake has 13 more apples than Steven, so he has 12 + 13 = 25 apples.
3. Jake has 17 fewer peaches than Steven, so he has 8 - 17 = -9 peaches.
4. Wait a minute, how can Jake have negative peaches? That doesn't make sense.
5. We made a mistake in step 3. Jake cannot have negative peaches, so we need to adjust our calculation.
6. Instead of saying Jake has 17 fewer peaches than Steven, we can say he has 17 more apples than peaches.
7. So, Jake has 25 apples and 8 peaches - 17 = -9 apples + 17 = 8 peaches.

Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages. It took frank 664 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?,332.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages. It took frank 664 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of pages in the book. Since there are 2 chapters and each chapter has 405 pages, the total number of pages is:

2 x 405 = 810 pages

Next, we need to find how many pages Frank read per day. To do this, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days it took him to finish the book:

810 pages ÷ 664 days = 1.22 pages per day

However, the question asks how many chapters Frank read per day, not how many pages. Since we know that each chapter has 405 pages, we can divide the pages per day by the number of pages in a chapter:

1.22 pages per day ÷ 405 pages per chapter = 0.003 chapters per day

So, Frank read approximately 0.003 chapters per day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",0.003 chapters per day.,False,False

Step 4: To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 2 to both sides: -2 + x + 2 = 23 + 2, which simplifies to x = 25.
Step 5: Jessica cut 25 roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",25,False,False
"Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework, 10 pages of reading homework and 6 more pages of biology homework. How many pages of reading and biology homework did she have to complete?",16.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework, 10 pages of reading homework and 6 more pages of biology homework. How many pages of reading and biology homework did she have to complete?

A: Let's think step by step. Rachel had to complete:
- 5 pages of math homework
- 10 pages of reading homework
- 6 more pages of biology homework

So, the total number of pages of biology homework is 6 more than some unknown number of pages of reading homework. Let's call the number of pages of reading homework ""x"". 

Therefore, the total number of pages of biology homework is x + 6. 

And we know that Rachel had to complete a total of 5 + 10 + (x + 6) pages of homework. 

Simplifying this expression, we get: 

5 + 10 + x + 6 = 21 + x 

So, Rachel had to complete 21 + x pages of homework in total. 

To answer the question, we just need to find the value of x. 

We know that Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework, so the total number of pages of homework she had to complete (21 + x) must be at least 5. 

Therefore: 

21 + x ≥ 5 

Subtracting 21 from both sides: 

x ≥ -16 

This means that Rachel had to complete at least -16 pages of reading homework, which doesn't make sense. So, we made a mistake somewhere. 

Let's go back to the problem and check if we missed any information. 

Ah, we did miss something! The problem says that Rachel had to complete a total of 21 pages of homework, not 21 + x pages. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

5 + 10 + (x + 6) = 21 

Simplifying: 

x + 21 = 21 

Subtracting 21 from both sides: 

x = 0 

So, Rachel had to complete 0 pages of reading homework and 6 pages of biology homework. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",0 pages of reading homework and 6 pages of biology homework.,False,False

So, if we divide the total number of action figures by 10, we can find out how many shelves he needs. 

8 action figures / 10 action figures per shelf = 0.8 shelves 

However, we can't have 0.8 of a shelf, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

Rounding up 0.8 to the nearest whole number gives us 1. 

Therefore, Adam's room has 1 shelf. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1,False,False

Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven and 18 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 16 peaches. How many more peaches does Steven have than Jill?,27.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven and 18 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 16 peaches. How many more peaches does Steven have than Jill?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that Steven has 16 peaches.
2. Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 16 - 9 = 7 peaches.
3. Jake also has 18 more peaches than Jill, so Jill has 7 - 18 = -11 peaches. This doesn't make sense, so we made a mistake somewhere.
4. Let's try a different approach. We know that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can write an equation: J = S - 9, where J is the number of peaches Jake has and S is the number of peaches Steven has.
5. We also know that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, so we can write another equation: J = J + 18, where J is the number of peaches Jill has.
6. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get: S - 9 = J + 18.
7. We know that Steven has 16 peaches, so we can substitute S = 16 into the equation: 16 - 9 = J + 18.
8. Simplifying the equation, we get: J = 7.
9. So Jake has 7 peaches and Jill has 7 - 18 = -11 peaches. This still doesn't make sense, so we made another mistake.
10. Let's try one more time. We know that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can write an equation: J = S - 9, where J is the number of peaches Jake has and S is the number of peaches Steven has.
11. We also know that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, so we can write another equation: J = J + 18, where J is the number of peaches Jill has.
12. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get: S - 9 = J + 18.
13. We know that Steven has 16 peaches, so we can substitute S = 16 into the equation: 16 - 9 = J + 18.
14. Simplifying the equation, we get: J = 7.
15. So Jake has 7 peaches and Jill has J - 18 = -11 peaches.

The next day she found 7 more bags worth of cans. How many more bags did she have on monday than she found on the next day?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many bags of cans Tiffany had in total.
- On Monday, she had 8 bags of cans.
- The next day, she found 7 more bags worth of cans.
- So in total, she had 8 + 7 = 15 bags of cans.

Step 2: Find out how many more bags she had on Monday than she found on the next day.
- On Monday, she had 8 bags of cans.
- The next day, she found 7 more bags worth of cans.
- So she had 15 bags of cans in total.
- To find out how many more bags she had on Monday than the next day, we need to subtract the number of bags she found the next day from the number of bags she had on Monday.

There are 3941 skittles in Steven's skittles collection. Steven also has 4950 erasers. If the erasers are organized into 495 groups How big is each group?,10.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: There are 3941 skittles in Steven's skittles collection. Steven also has 4950 erasers. If the erasers are organized into 495 groups How big is each group?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many erasers are in each group. We can do this by dividing the total number of erasers by the number of groups:

4950 ÷ 495 = 10

So each group has 10 erasers.

Next, we need to figure out what this has to do with the number of skittles in Steven's collection. It's possible that there's no connection at all, but let's assume that there is.

One way to approach this is to ask: how many skittles would Steven need to have in order for the number of skittles to be the same as the number of erasers in one group?

To answer this, we can divide the total number of skittles by the number of groups:

3941 ÷ 495 = 7.96

So Steven would need to have about 8 skittles in order for the number of skittles to be the same as the number of erasers in one group.

Of course, this is just an approximation, since you can't have a fraction of a skittle. But it gives us an idea of the relative sizes of the two collections. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10 erasers per group.,False,True
Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon How many students suggested bacon?,394.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon How many students suggested bacon?

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the number of students who suggested adding bacon ""x"". 

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. 

Also, we know that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon. So, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is ""x + 63"". 

Therefore, the total number of students who made suggestions is:

x + (x + 63) = 2x + 63 

And we know that the total number of students who made suggestions is 457 + x (the sum of those who suggested mashed potatoes and those who suggested bacon). 

So we can set up an equation: 

457 + x = 2x + 63 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

394 = x 

Therefore, 394 students suggested adding bacon to the menu. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",394,False,False

During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they offered a discount of $ 8 per t-shirt and sold 130 t-shirts. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the discounted price of each t-shirt:

Discounted price = Original price - Discount
Discounted price = $51 - $8
Discounted price = $43

Now, we know that they sold 130 t-shirts, so we can calculate the total revenue:

Total revenue = Number of t-shirts sold x Discounted price
Total revenue = 130 x $43
Total revenue = $5,590

Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $5,590 from selling the t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas tech game. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","$5,590.00 ",False,True
5 storks and 3 birds were sitting on the fence. 4 more birds came to join them.

How many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of birds and storks sitting on the fence: 

5 storks + 3 birds = 8 animals 

Then, we add the 4 more birds that came to join them: 

8 animals + 4 birds = 12 animals 

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of birds and storks: 

Number of birds = 3 original birds + 4 new birds = 7 birds 

Number of storks = 5 storks 

Difference = Number of birds - Number of storks = 7 - 5 = 2 

Therefore, there are 2 more birds than storks sitting on the fence. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2,False,True

2. He gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each of his 2 friends, so he gave away a total of 59 / 2 = 29.5 snacks to each friend.
3. Since you can't give away half a snack, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each friend received 29 snacks.
4. Since each friend received an equal number of crackers and cakes, they each received 29 / 2 = 14.5 cakes.
5. Again, we need to round down to the nearest whole number, so each person ate 14 cakes. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",14 cakes.,False,False

41 campers went rowing and 4 campers went hiking in the morning. 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon. How many campers went rowing and hiking in all?,71.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: 41 campers went rowing and 4 campers went hiking in the morning. 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon. How many campers went rowing and hiking in all?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 41 campers went rowing in the morning and 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon. So in total, 41 + 26 = 67 campers went rowing.

Next, we know that 4 campers went hiking in the morning. We don't know how many campers went hiking in the afternoon, but we do know that the question is asking for the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all.

So we need to add the number of campers who went rowing and hiking in the morning to the number of campers who went rowing and hiking in the afternoon. We know that 4 campers went hiking in the morning, but we don't know how many of those 41 campers who went rowing in the morning also went hiking.

Let's call the number of campers who went rowing and hiking in the morning ""x"". Then we can set up an equation:

x + 4 = the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all

We know that the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all is 67 (the number who went rowing) plus some unknown number ""x"" who also went hiking. So we can rewrite the equation as:

x + 4 = 67 + x

Now we can solve for ""x"":

x - x = 67 - 4
0 = 63

Uh oh, something went wrong! We ended up with an equation that doesn't make sense. What happened?

Well, let's think about what the equation is saying. It's saying that the number of campers who went rowing and hiking in the morning plus 4 (the number who went hiking in the morning) is equal to the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all. But that doesn't make sense, because some of the campers who went rowing in the morning might not have gone hiking at all, and some of the campers who went rowing in the afternoon might have gone hiking instead.

So we need to approach the problem differently. One way to do this is to use a Venn diagram. We can draw two circles, one for rowing and one for hiking, and label the parts that we know:

```
         Rowing
        /      \
Morning        Afternoon
  41              26
        \ Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","We can see from the Venn diagram that there is no overlap between the morning hiking group and the afternoon rowing group. So the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all is:

41 (morning rowing and hiking) + 0 (no overlap with afternoon rowing) + 0 (no overlap with morning hiking) + 0 (no overlap with afternoon hiking) = 41

Therefore, 41 campers went rowing and hiking in all.",False,False

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Jessica started with 15 roses in the vase.
Step 2: She threw away 33 roses, so now there are 15 - 33 = -18 roses in the vase. This doesn't make sense, so we know we made a mistake.
Step 3: We need to add the new roses that Jessica cut from her garden. Let's call this number ""x"". So now we have: 15 - 33 + x = 17.
Step 4: We can simplify this equation by adding 33 to both sides: 15 + x = 50.
Step 5: Now we can solve for x by subtracting 15 from both sides: x = 35.
Step 6: Finally, we can answer the question by finding the difference between the number of roses Jessica cut and the number she threw away: 35 - 33 = 2. 

Therefore, Jessica cut 2 more roses than she threw away. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2,False,False

How many pencils does she have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many pencils Faye has in total. She has 6 packs of pencils, and each pack has 14 pencils. So, she has 6 * 14 = <<6*14=84>>84 pencils.

Now, Faye is placing her pencils into rows with 22 pencils in each row. To find out how many rows she can make, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row:

84 pencils / 22 pencils per row = <<84/22=3.8181818181818183>>3.8181818181818183 rows

Since Faye can't have a fraction of a row, she can make 3 full rows of pencils with 22 pencils in each row. This means she will use 3 * 22 = <<3*22=66>>66 pencils for the full rows.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many games Kelly needs to have in total to have 140 games left. To do this, we can use the equation:

Total games = Current games + Games to buy

We know that Kelly currently has 22 games, so we can plug that into the equation:

Total games = 22 + Games to buy

Now, we need to find out how many games Kelly needs to buy so that she will have 140 games left. To do this, we can use the equation:

Games left = Total games - Games to buy

We know that Kelly wants to have 140 games left, so we can plug that into the equation:

140 = Total games - Games to buy

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for the number of games Kelly needs to buy:

140 = (22 + Games to buy) - Games to buy

Now, we can solve for the number of games Kelly needs to buy:

140 = 22 + Games to buy - Games to buy

140 = 22

She already put in 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour does she need to add?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cups of flour Mary needs to add to match the amount of sugar she already put in. Since she put in 60 cups of sugar, and the recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar, we can find out how many times she multiplied the sugar by dividing 60 by 6. 

60 ÷ 6 = 10

So, Mary put in 10 times the amount of sugar the recipe calls for. Now, we need to find out how many cups of flour she needs to match this amount. Since the recipe calls for 14 cups of flour, we can multiply this by 10:

14 × 10 = 140

So, Jessica cut 4 roses from her garden. 

Now let's do the same for the orchids: 

20 orchids (final) - 12 orchids (initial) = 8 orchids 

So, Jessica cut 8 orchids from her garden. 

Now we want to find out how many more orchids than roses are in the vase. We know there are 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase now. 

To find the difference between the number of orchids and roses, we can subtract the number of roses from the number of orchids:

Since he has 8 more peaches than Jill, we can find out how many peaches Jill has by subtracting 8 from Steven's number of peaches: 5 - 8 = -3. So Jill has -3 peaches, which doesn't make sense in real life, but let's continue with the problem.

Now, we know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven. So, we subtract 3 from Steven's number of peaches: 5 - 3 = 2. So Jake has 2 peaches.

Finally, we want to find out how many more peaches Jake has than Jill. We subtract Jill's number of peaches from Jake's number of peaches: 2 - (-3) = 2 + 3 = 5.

So, Jake has 5 more peaches than Jill. However, since it's impossible for Jill to have a negative number of peaches, this problem doesn't make sense in real life. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5,False,False

If she drank 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a day How many days would the soda bottles last?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many soda bottles Debby has left after drinking 9 soda bottles a day. To do this, we can use the formula:

Total soda bottles - (Number of soda bottles drunk per day * Number of days) = Remaining soda bottles

We know the total number of soda bottles is 360, and Debby drinks 9 soda bottles a day. We want to find out how many days the soda bottles would last, so we can represent the number of days with the variable ""x"". Now we can set up the equation:

360 - (9 * x) = Remaining soda bottles

Now we need to solve for x. Since Debby drinks all the soda bottles, the remaining soda bottles will be 0. So we can set up the equation:

360 - (9 * x) = 0

Now we can solve for x:

9 * x = 360

x = 360 / 9

x = 40

So the soda bottles would last for 40 days. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",40,False,False

5 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?,9.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: 5 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Initially, there were 5 children on the bus.
2. At the bus stop, 63 children got off the bus. So, the number of children on the bus decreased from 5 to 5-63 = -58. This means there were no children left on the bus after the 63 got off.
3. Then, some more children got on the bus. Let's say x children got on the bus.
4. Now, the total number of children on the bus is 14. So, we can write an equation:
5 - 63 + x = 14
5. Solving for x, we get:
x = 72
6. So, 72 children got on the bus after 63 got off.
7. To find how many more children got on than those that got off, we can subtract:
72 - 63 = 9
8. Therefore, 9 more children got on the bus than those that got off. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9,False,False
Debby bought 95 soda bottles and 180 water bottles when they were on sale.

If she drank 15 water bottles and 54 soda bottles a day How many days would the water bottles last?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Debby bought a total of 95 + 180 = 275 bottles.
2. She drank 15 water bottles a day, so the water bottles would last for 180 / 15 = 12 days.
3. She drank 54 soda bottles a day, but we don't know how many days they would last. Let's find out.
4. Debby has 95 + 180 = 275 bottles in total.
5. She drank 15 water bottles a day, so after 12 days she would have drunk 15 x 12 = 180 water bottles.
6. She would have 275 - 180 = 95 soda bottles left after 12 days.
7. She drinks 54 soda bottles a day, so the remaining 95 soda bottles would last for 95 / 54 = 1.76 days (rounded to two decimal places).
8. Therefore, the water bottles would last for 12 days, and the soda bottles would last for 1.76 days. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",12 days.,False,True

How many people can ride 20 Ferris wheels at the same time?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many people can ride one Ferris wheel at the same time:

- Each seat can hold 15 people, and there are 19 seats in one Ferris wheel.
- So, the total number of people that can ride one Ferris wheel at the same time is 15 x 19 = 285.

Now, let's use this information to find out how many people can ride 20 Ferris wheels at the same time:

- We know that one Ferris wheel can hold 285 people at the same time.
- So, 20 Ferris wheels can hold 285 x 20 = 5700 people at the same time.

Therefore, 5700 people can ride 20 Ferris wheels at the same time in Paradise Park. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5700,False,False

"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?",57.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We need to find the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days. 

To do this, we can add up the number of visitors from the previous two days and multiply by 245: 

Total visitors in previous 245 days = (191 + 457) x 245 = 164,420 

2. Now we need to find the difference between the total visitors in the previous 245 days and the number of visitors on the current day: 

Difference = 705 - 164,420 = -163,715 

Wait a minute, a negative number? That doesn't make sense. 

It seems like there might be an error in the question. Perhaps it was meant to ask how many more visitors came on that day compared to the average number of visitors in the previous 245 days? 

If we assume that's the case, we can calculate the average number of visitors per day in the previous 245 days: 

Average visitors per day = Total visitors / Number of days = 164,420 / 245 = 670.94 (rounded to two decimal places) 

Now we can find the difference between the number of visitors on the current day and the average number of visitors per day in the previous 245 days: 

Difference = 705 - 670.94 = 34.06 (rounded to two decimal places) 

So the answer is that 34 more visitors came to the Buckingham palace on that day compared to the average number of visitors in the previous 245 days. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",34,False,False

How many books did he sell in the garage sale?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Start with the initial number of books and pens: Paul had 108 books and 55 pens.
2. Then, we know that he sold some books and pens in a garage sale, so we need to subtract the final number of books and pens from the initial number: 

- Final number of books: 66
- Final number of pens: 59

- Difference in books: 108 - 66 = 42
- Difference in pens: 55 - 59 = -4

3. We can see that Paul actually ended up with more pens than he started with, which means he must have bought or received some additional pens. Therefore, we can ignore the negative difference in pens and focus on the difference in books: 

- Difference in books: 42

Therefore, Paul sold 42 books in the garage sale. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",42,False,True

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary.
2. We also know that David did 38 push-ups.
3. So, we can use subtraction to find out how many push-ups Zachary did: 

   Zachary's push-ups = David's push-ups - 56
                      = 38 - 56
                      = -18

   Uh oh, this doesn't make sense! We can't have negative push-ups. This means there must be an error in the problem. 

   Perhaps the problem meant to say that Zachary did 56 fewer push-ups than David. In that case, we would use addition instead of subtraction: 

   Zachary's push-ups = David's push-ups - 56
                      = 38 - 56
                      = -18

   Zachary's push-ups = David's push-ups + 56
                      = 38 + 56
                      = 94

   Now we have a reasonable answer! 

4. To find the total number of push-ups, we simply add David's and Zachary's push-ups: 

   Total push-ups = David's push-ups + Zachary's push-ups
                  = 38 + 94
                  = 132

   So, David and Zachary did 132 push-ups altogether. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",132,False,False

2. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, which means Jake has 19 - 12 = 7 peaches.
3. Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill, but we don't know how many peaches Jill has.
4. Let's use algebra to solve for Jill's number of peaches. We can write an equation: Jake's peaches = Jill's peaches + 72. We know Jake has 7 peaches, so we can substitute that in: 7 = Jill's peaches + 72.
5. Solving for Jill's peaches, we subtract 72 from both sides: Jill's peaches = -65.
6. Wait a minute, a negative number of peaches doesn't make sense! We made a mistake somewhere.
7. Let's go back to step 2. We assumed that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, but that might not be the case. It's possible that Jake has 12 more peaches than Steven, which would make more sense.
8. So let's try that: Jake has 12 more peaches than Steven, which means Jake has 19 + 12 = 31 peaches.
9. Now we can use the same equation as before to solve for Jill's peaches: Jake's peaches = Jill's peaches + 72. We know Jake has 31 peaches, so we can substitute that in: 31 = Jill's peaches + 72.
10. Solving for Jill's peaches, we subtract 72 from both sides: Jill's peaches = -41.
11. Oops, we still got a negative number of peaches! We made another mistake somewhere.
12. Let's go back to step 8. We assumed that Jake has 12 more peaches than Steven, but that might not be the case either. It's possible that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, which would make even more sense.
13. So let's try that: Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, which means Jake has 19 - 12 = 7 peaches.

How much did she weigh before starting to jog?

A: Let's think step by step. Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms. 

After jogging everyday, she lost 101 kilograms. 

This means her current weight is 27 - 101 = -74 kilograms. 

However, this doesn't make sense because a person's weight cannot be negative. 

Therefore, we can assume that there is an error in the question. 

Perhaps Jessie lost 10.1 kilograms instead of 101 kilograms. 

In that case, her current weight would be 27 - 10.1 = 16.9 kilograms.

2. At the bus stop, 10 children got off the bus. So, the number of children on the bus decreased to 21 - 10 = 11.
3. After that, some more children got on the bus. Let's say x children got on the bus.
4. So, the total number of children on the bus became 11 + x.
5. But we know that eventually, there were 16 children on the bus.
6. So, we can write an equation based on the above information: 11 + x = 16.
7. Solving for x, we get x = 16 - 11 = 5.
8. Therefore, 5 children got on the bus at the bus stop. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5,False,False

Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he only had 291 crayons left since he had either lost or given away 315 of them. How many crayons did he get for his birthday?,606.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he only had 291 crayons left since he had either lost or given away 315 of them. How many crayons did he get for his birthday?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Paul had some crayons at the beginning of the school year.
2. He got a box of crayons for his birthday.
3. By the end of the school year, he had 291 crayons left.
4. He either lost or gave away 315 crayons.
5. We need to find out how many crayons he got for his birthday.

To solve this problem, we can use subtraction. We know that Paul had some crayons before his birthday, and then he got a box of crayons for his birthday. So, the total number of crayons he had at the beginning of the school year is:

Total number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday

We don't know how many crayons Paul had before his birthday, but we can use the information we have to find out. We know that he lost or gave away 315 crayons, so we can write:

Total number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315

We also know that by the end of the school year, Paul had 291 crayons left. So we can write:

291 = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315

Now we can solve for Crayons from birthday:

Crayons from birthday = 291 + 315 - Crayons before birthday

We don't know Crayons before birthday, but we know that it must be less than or equal to 291 (since Paul had 291 crayons left at the end of the school year). So we can try different values of Crayons before birthday until we find one that works. Let's start with Crayons before birthday = 0:

Crayons from birthday = 291 + 315 - 0 = 606

This means that Paul got 606 crayons for his birthday! Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",606,False,True

He found out that they harvest 16 sacks per day and that each sack containes 57 oranges. How many days will it take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many oranges are in 80 sacks. 

To do this, we can multiply the number of oranges in one sack (57) by the number of sacks we want to harvest (80): 

57 x 80 = 4,560 

So, we need to harvest 4,560 oranges in total. 

Next, we need to figure out how many days it will take to harvest this many oranges if they harvest 16 sacks per day. 

To do this, we can divide the total number of oranges we need to harvest (4,560) by the number of oranges they harvest per day (16 sacks x 57 oranges per sack = 912 oranges per day): 

4,560 ÷ 912 = 5

The program could seat 44 people How many people were present in the program?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add the number of parents and pupils to find out how many people were supposed to attend the program:

61 parents + 177 pupils = 238 people

However, we know that the program could only seat 44 people. This means that only 44 people could physically be present at the program at any given time.

So, we need to figure out how many people actually attended the program. We know that the maximum number of people who could attend was 44, so we need to find the minimum number of times that 44 can go into 238.

238 ÷ 44 = 5 with a remainder of 18

This means that 5 groups of 44 people could attend the program, with 18 people left over. However, since we know that the program could only seat 44 people at a time, we need to round up to the next whole number.

5 groups + 1 extra group = 6 groups

So, there were 6 groups of people who attended the program, with 44 people in each group, and 18 people left over. To find out how many people were present in the program, we need to add up the number of people in each group, plus the 18 extra people:

6 groups x 44 people per group = 264 people

Dan has $ 2. He bought some candy bar for $ 6 each one costing $ 3. How many candy bar did he buy?,2.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Dan has $ 2. He bought some candy bar for $ 6 each one costing $ 3. How many candy bar did he buy?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Dan has $2.
2. Each candy bar costs $3.
3. Dan bought some candy bars for a total of $6 each.
4. We can use algebra to solve for the number of candy bars Dan bought. Let's call the number of candy bars x.
5. The total cost of the candy bars is 6x (since he bought some candy bars for a total of $6 each).
6. We know that Dan had $2 to start with, so we can set up an equation: 

2 + 6x = 3x 

7. Now we can solve for x: 

2 + 6x = 3x 

2 = -3x 

x = -2/3 

8. This doesn't make sense - you can't buy a negative number of candy bars! So we know there's an error somewhere. 

9. Let's go back to step 6. We made a mistake - the equation should be: 

2 + 6x = total cost of candy bars 

10. Now we can set up the correct equation: 

2 + 6x = total cost of candy bars 

11. We know that each candy bar costs $3, so we can write: 

total cost of candy bars = 3x 

12. Now we can substitute this into our equation: 

2 + 6x = 3x 

13. Simplifying: 

2 + 3x = 0 

3x = -2 

x = -2/3 

14. This still doesn't make sense - you can't buy a negative number of candy bars! 

15. We made another mistake - we assumed that Dan bought some candy bars for a total of $6 each. But we don't know how many candy bars he bought at that price. 

16. Let's call the number of candy bars he bought at $6 each y. 

17. We know that each candy bar he bought at $6 each costs $6, so we can write: 

total cost of candy bars bought at $6 each = 6y 

18. We also know that each candy bar he bought at $3 each costs $3, so we can write: 

total cost of candy bars bought at $3 each = 3(x-y) 

19. Now we can set up an equation for the total cost of all the candy bars: 

total cost of candy Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",not possible to determine with the given information.,False,False

If they are travelling at speed of 17 How much farther until they reach the end of the cave?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much deeper the cave is from their current position:

1218 feet (total depth) - 849 feet (current position) = 369 feet

So they still need to descend 369 feet to reach the end of the cave.

Next, we need to figure out how long it will take them to descend that distance at a speed of 17 feet per unit of time. We can use the formula:

distance = speed x time

To solve for time, we can rearrange the formula:

time = distance / speed

Plugging in the values we know:

time = 369 feet / 17 feet per unit of time

time ≈ 21.7 units of time

So it will take them approximately 21.7 units of time to descend the remaining distance.

Note: We don't know what the units of time are (seconds, minutes, hours, etc.) so we can't give an exact time in real-world units. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",369 / 17 ≈ 21.7.,False,False

"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 92 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace before that day?",522.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 92 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace before that day?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that there were 92 visitors on the day Rachel went to see the Buckingham palace.
2. We also know that there were 419 visitors the previous day.
3. And we know that there were 103 visitors the day before that.
4. We want to find out how many visitors there were before that day.

To solve this problem, we need to add up the number of visitors from the three days we know and subtract that from the total number of visitors up to that day.

Total visitors up to the day Rachel went = visitors on Rachel's day + visitors the previous day + visitors the day before that + visitors before that day

We know the first three terms:

Total visitors up to the day Rachel went = 92 + 419 + 103 + visitors before that day

We can simplify this equation:

Total visitors up to the day Rachel went = 614 + visitors before that day

We also know that the total number of visitors up to that day includes the visitors on the day Rachel went:

Total visitors up to the day Rachel went = visitors on Rachel's day + visitors before that day

We can substitute this into the previous equation:

visitors on Rachel's day + visitors before that day = 614 + visitors before that day

We can simplify this equation:

visitors on Rachel's day = 614

Therefore, there were 614 visitors before the day Rachel went to see the Buckingham palace. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",614,False,False

There, Rachel learned that 100 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 666 visitors on that day How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the difference between the number of visitors on the current day and the previous day. 

Difference = Number of visitors on current day - Number of visitors on previous day 

We know that there were 666 visitors on the current day and 100 visitors on the previous day. 

Difference = 666 - 100 

Difference = 566 

Therefore, there were 566 more visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on the current day than on the previous day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",566,False,True

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Danny lost 66 bottle caps at the park.
2. Now he has 25 bottle caps in his collection.
3. We want to know how many bottle caps Danny had at first.

To solve this problem, we need to use subtraction and addition. We know that Danny had some bottle caps at first, then he lost 66, and now he has 25. So:

Danny's original number of bottle caps - 66 (lost) + 25 (current) = total number of bottle caps

Let's use a variable to represent the unknown original number of bottle caps:

x - 66 + 25 = total number of bottle caps

Simplifying the equation:

x - 41 = total number of bottle caps

To find the total number of bottle caps, we need to add 41 to both sides of the equation:

x = total number of bottle caps + 41

Now we can see that Danny had x bottle caps at first, which is equal to the total number of bottle caps he has now (25) plus the number of bottle caps he lost (66), plus 41:

x = 25 + 66 + 41
x = 132

The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches. 

Second, we know that the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. Let's call the distance the frog jumped ""x"". Then, the grasshopper jumped x + 4 inches. 

Third, we know that the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. So, the mouse jumped x - 44 inches. 

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x: 

x + 4 (grasshopper's jump) + x (frog's jump) + x - 44 (mouse's jump) = total distance 

Simplifying this equation: 

3x - 40 = total distance - 19 

We don't know the total distance, but we can simplify the left side: 

3x - 40 = total distance - 19 

3x - 21 = total distance 

Now we can solve for x: 

3x - 21 = total distance 

3x - 21 = 19 + x + x - 44 

3x - 21 = 2x - 25 

x = 4 

Therefore, the frog jumped 4 inches. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4 inches.,False,False

Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes How many students suggested bacon?,348.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes How many students suggested bacon?

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes ""x"". 

According to the problem, we know that:

- 182 students suggested mashed potatoes
- Some other students suggested adding bacon
- The number of students who suggested bacon is 166 more than those who suggested mashed potatoes

So, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

x + (x + 166) = total number of students who suggested bacon

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x + 166 = total number of students who suggested bacon

Now, we also know that the total number of students who suggested food is the sum of those who suggested mashed potatoes and those who suggested bacon:

total number of students who suggested food = 182 + (2x + 166)

We can simplify this equation as well:

total number of students who suggested food = 348 + 2x

Finally, we know that the total number of students who suggested food is 182 + 166 = 348 (since every student who suggested food either suggested mashed potatoes or bacon). So we can set up one more equation:

total number of students who suggested food = 348

Now we have two equations with two variables:

total number of students who suggested food = 348 = 348 + 2x - 2x

total number of students who suggested food = 348 = 182 + (2x + 166)

Solving the first equation, we get:

0 = 0

This equation doesn't give us any new information, but it confirms that our equations are consistent.

Solving the second equation, we get:

166 = 2x

x = 83

So 83 students suggested mashed potatoes, and:

x + 166 = 83 + 166 = 249

249 students suggested bacon. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",249,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Baker made 52 pastries and 84 cakes.
2. He sold 102 cakes and 94 pastries.
3. To find out how many more cakes than pastries he made, we need to subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of pastries made, and subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of cakes made.
4. So, the calculation would be: 

    Number of cakes made - Number of cakes sold = Number of cakes left
    84 - 102 = -18 (negative means he sold more cakes than he made)

    Number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold = Number of pastries left
    52 - 94 = -42 (negative means he sold more pastries than he made)

5. Since we want to know how many more cakes than pastries he made, we need to subtract the number of pastries left from the number of cakes left:

Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. How many more roses than orchids are there in the vase now?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with the initial number of roses and orchids in the vase.

Initial number of roses = 6
Initial number of orchids = 20

Step 2: Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden.

Let's say Jessica cut x roses and y orchids from her garden.

Number of roses after cutting = 6 + x
Number of orchids after cutting = 20 + y

Step 3: There are now 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase.

Number of roses after cutting = 22
Number of orchids after cutting = 21

So, we can write two equations based on the above information:

6 + x + y = 22   (equation 1)
20 + x + y = 21  (equation 2)

Simplifying equation 2, we get:

x + y = 1

Substituting this value in equation 1, we get:

6 + 1 = 22
x = 15

So, Jessica cut 15 roses from her garden.

Now, we can find the number of orchids after cutting:

20 + y = 21
y = 1

So, Jessica cut 1 orchid from her garden.

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of roses and orchids in the vase:

Number of roses = 22
Number of orchids = 21

Difference = 22 - 21 = 1

Therefore, there is only 1 more rose than orchid in the vase now. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1,False,False

To do this, we can divide the total number of oranges (63) by the number of groups (95): 

63 ÷ 95 = 0.663 

So each group of oranges has approximately 0.663 oranges. However, since we can't have a fraction of an orange, we can round this up to 1 orange per group. 

Therefore, each group of bananas has 29 bananas and each group of oranges has 1 orange. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",29 bananas per group and 1 orange per group.,False,True

How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug, so we can write:

Ed = Doug + 24

2. Doug lost 27 marbles, so we need to subtract 27 from his original number of marbles:

Doug - 27

3. Ed found 9 more marbles, so we need to add 9 to his original number of marbles:

Ed + 9

4. Now we can substitute the first equation into the second and third equations:

Doug - 27 = (Doug + 24) - 27
Ed + 9 = (Doug + 24) + 9

5. Simplifying these equations, we get:

Doug - 27 = Doug - 4
Ed + 9 = Doug + 33

6. Subtracting Doug from both sides of the first equation, we get:

-27 = -4

This is not true, so there must be an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

We made a mistake in step 4. We should have substituted the first equation into the third equation, not the second equation. Let's try again:

Doug - 27 = (Doug + 24) - 27
Ed + 9 = (Doug + 24) + 9

7. Simplifying these equations, we get:

Doug - 27 = Doug - 3
Ed + 9 = Doug + 33

8. Subtracting Doug from both sides of the first equation, we get:

-27 = -3

This is still not true, so there must be another error. Let's check our work again.

We made another mistake in step 7. We should have added 24 to Doug in the second equation, not 33. Let's try again:

Doug - 27 = (Doug + 24) - 27
Ed + 9 = (Doug + 24) + 9

9. Simplifying these equations, we get:

Doug - 27 = Doug - 3
Ed + 9 = Doug + 33

10. Subtracting Doug from both sides of the first equation, we get:

-27 = -3

This is still not true, so there must be another error. Let's check our work again.

We made another mistake in step 1. We should have written:

Doug = Ed - 24

Let's start over with the correct equation Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",24 more marbles.,False,False

How many marbles did Ed lose?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's use a variable to represent the number of marbles Doug has. Let's call it D. Since Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, we can represent the number of marbles Ed had as D + 19.

Now, Ed lost some marbles and has 8 more marbles than Doug. So, the number of marbles Ed has now is D + 8.

To find out how many marbles Ed lost, we need to subtract the number of marbles he has now (D + 8) from the number of marbles he had before (D + 19).

So, the number of marbles Ed lost is (D + 19) - (D + 8).

D + 19 - D - 8 = 19 - 8 = 11

So, Ed lost 11 marbles. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",11,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches.
2. David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups.
3. David did 62 less crunches than Zachary, so he did 58 - 62 = -4 crunches. This doesn't make sense, as you can't do negative crunches.
4. Therefore, we made a mistake in step 3. Let's try again.
5. David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups.
6. David did 62 less crunches than Zachary, so he did 58 - 62 = -4 crunches. This still doesn't make sense.
7. Let's try a different approach. We know that Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches, so he did 58 - 46 = 12 more crunches than push-ups.
8. David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups.
9. David did 12 less crunches than Zachary (since Zachary did 12 more crunches than push-ups), so he did 58 - 12 = 46 crunches.
10. Therefore, Zachary did 12 more crunches than push-ups. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",12,False,False

If he had 32 crackers and 98 cakes initially How many crackers did each person eat?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends, so he gave a total of 4 x (number of crackers and cakes given to each friend) crackers and cakes.
2. We know that he had 32 crackers and 98 cakes initially, so the total number of crackers and cakes he gave to his friends is 32 + 98 = 130.
3. To find out how many crackers each person ate, we need to divide the total number of crackers by the number of friends. Since he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes, we can assume that he gave the same number of crackers as cakes to each friend. Therefore, the number of crackers given to each friend is equal to the number of cakes given to each friend.
4. Dividing 130 by 4, we get 32.5. However, we cannot give half a cracker to each person, so we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each person ate 32 crackers. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",32 crackers.,False,False

How many apples does Bob have?,20.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's start by using variables to represent the number of apples each person has. Let's call Adam's number of apples ""A"" and Jackie's number of apples ""J"". 

2. We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so we can write an equation: 

A = J + 4 

3. We also know that together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples, so we can write another equation: 

A + J = 14 

4. Now we need to find out how many apples Bob has. We know that Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together do, so we can write another equation: 

B = A + J + 6 

5. We can use the first two equations to solve for A and J: 

A = J + 4 

A + J = 14 

Substituting the first equation into the second equation: 

(J + 4) + J = 14 

2J + 4 = 14 

2J = 10 

J = 5 

So Jackie has 5 apples. 

Using the first equation, we can find that Adam has: 

A = J + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 

So Adam has 9 apples. 

6. Now we can use the third equation to find out how many apples Bob has: 

B = A + J + 6 = 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 

So Bob has 20 apples. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",20,False,True

There are 120 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. There are 84 seats on each school bus. How many students are in each class?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that there are 120 students in the school and 24 classrooms. So, we can divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms to find out how many students are in each class:

120 students ÷ 24 classrooms = 5 students per class

2. We also know that there are 84 seats on each school bus. So, we can divide the number of students in each class by the number of seats on the bus to find out how many buses are needed for the field trip:

5 students per class ÷ 84 seats per bus = 0.06 buses per class

3. Since we can't have 0.06 buses, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means that each class will need at least 1 bus for the field trip.

Therefore, there are 5 students in each class. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5,False,False

There were 21 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 15 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?,6.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: There were 21 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 15 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?

A: Let's think step by step. First, Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase, so the number of roses in the vase decreased from 21 to 21 - 34 = -13. This doesn't make sense, as you can't have negative roses in a vase!

So, we need to adjust our approach. Let's start again with the information we have:

- There were 21 roses in the vase.
- Jessica threw away some roses from the vase.
- Jessica cut some new roses from her garden.
- There are now 15 roses in the vase.

To find out how many roses Jessica threw away more than those she cut from her garden, we need to figure out how many roses she cut from her garden in the first place.

We know that the total number of roses in the vase decreased from 21 to 15, which means that Jessica threw away 21 - 15 = 6 roses.

Let's call the number of roses Jessica cut from her garden ""x"". We can set up an equation to represent the total number of roses in the vase after Jessica cut some new ones and threw away some old ones:

21 - 34 + x = 15

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = 28

So Jessica cut 28 new roses from her garden. Now we can answer the original question: how many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?

Jessica threw away 6 roses, and she cut 28 roses from her garden. Therefore, she threw away 28 - 6 = 22 more roses than those she cut from her garden. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",22,False,False

Together Adam and Jackie have 6 apples. He has 4 apples more than adam and jackie together do. How many apples does he have?,10.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Together Adam and Jackie have 6 apples. He has 4 apples more than adam and jackie together do. How many apples does he have?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's start by using variables to represent the unknowns. Let's call the number of apples Adam has ""A"" and the number of apples Jackie has ""J"". We know that A + J = 6, since together they have 6 apples.

2. We also know that ""he"" (presumably someone other than Adam or Jackie) has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie together. Let's call the number of apples ""he"" has ""H"". Then we can write an equation: H = A + J + 4.

3. Now we can use the first equation to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Let's solve for J: J = 6 - A.

4. We can substitute this expression for J into the second equation: H = A + (6 - A) + 4.

5. Simplifying this equation, we get: H = 10 - A.

6. Now we have two equations for H: H = A + J + 4 and H = 10 - A. We can set them equal to each other: A + J + 4 = 10 - A.

7. Substituting J = 6 - A, we get: A + (6 - A) + 4 = 10 - A.

8. Simplifying this equation, we get: 10 = 2A + 4.

9. Solving for A, we get: A = 3.

10. Using the equation J = 6 - A, we get: J = 3.

11. Finally, we can use either equation for H to find the answer. Using H = A + J + 4, we get: H = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10.

Therefore, ""he"" has 10 apples. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10,False,False

"Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 3 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 594 pages. It took Frank 607 days to finish the book. How many pages are in each chapter?",198.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 3 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 594 pages. It took Frank 607 days to finish the book. How many pages are in each chapter?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula:

total pages = number of chapters x pages per chapter

Since we know the total pages and the number of chapters (3), we can solve for the pages per chapter:

594 = 3 x pages per chapter

pages per chapter = 594 / 3

pages per chapter = 198

So each chapter has 198 pages.

Now, let's use the fact that it took Frank 607 days to finish the book. We can set up another formula:

time to finish book = time per chapter x number of chapters

Since each chapter has the same number of pages, we can assume that Frank spent the same amount of time reading each chapter. Let's call this time per chapter ""t"". Then:

607 = t x 3

t = 607 / 3

t = 202.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

So Frank spent about 202.33 days reading each chapter.

To check our answer, we can multiply the pages per chapter by the time per chapter:

198 x 202.33 = 40000.34 (rounded to two decimal places)

This is the total number of pages Frank would have read if he spent exactly 202.33 days reading each chapter. Since the actual total is 594 pages, our answer is reasonable. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",198 pages per chapter.,False,True

Area of the room = 80 square feet 

Now we know that we need 80 square feet of carpet to cover the whole floor. 

However, Jesse already has 18 square feet of carpet. 

So, the amount of carpet she still needs = total carpet needed - carpet she already has 

Amount of carpet she still needs = 80 square feet - 18 square feet 

Amount of carpet she still needs = 62 square feet 

Therefore, Jesse still needs 62 square feet of carpet to cover the whole floor. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",62,False,False

2. He gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends.
3. After giving crackers to his friends, he still had 17 crackers left.

To find out how many crackers Matthew gave to his friends, we can use subtraction. We know that he started with 24 crackers and ended up with 17, so he must have given away 7 crackers. 

Now we need to divide those 7 crackers equally among his 3 friends. We can use division to find out how many crackers each friend received. 

7 crackers ÷ 3 friends = 2 remainder 1

This means that each friend received 2 crackers, and Matthew had 1 cracker left over.

Distance grasshopper jumped = x + 25 

Distance mouse jumped = x - 16 

To find the difference, we can subtract the distance the mouse jumped from the distance the grasshopper jumped: 

(x + 25) - (x - 16) 

Simplifying: 

x + 25 - x + 16 

The ""x"" terms cancel out, leaving us with: 

25 + 16 = 41 

Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 41 inches farther than the mouse. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",41,False,False

There, Rachel learned that 512 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 471 visitors the previous day and 808 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace within the past 89 days?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace in the past three days:

- 512 visitors today
- 471 visitors yesterday
- 808 visitors the day before yesterday

To find the total number of visitors in the past three days, we add these numbers:

512 + 471 + 808 = 1791

So, 1791 visitors came to the Buckingham palace in the past three days.

Next, we need to find out how many visitors came to the palace in the past 89 days. We can use proportions to do this.

If 1791 visitors came in the past three days, then how many visitors came in one day on average?

To find out, we divide 1791 by 3:

1791 / 3 = 597

So, on average, 597 visitors came to the Buckingham palace each day in the past three days.

Now, we can use proportions to find out how many visitors came in the past 89 days:

If 597 visitors came each day on average, then how many visitors came in 89 days?

To find out, we multiply 597 by 89:

597 x 89 = 53133

So, 53,133 visitors came to the Buckingham palace in the past 89 days. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","53,133.00",False,False

If he has 27 books and 80 magazines in each of his 23 bookshelves How many books does he have in total?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many books Bryan has in one bookshelf. We know that he has 27 books and 80 magazines in each of his 23 bookshelves, so we can use this information to find out:

27 books + 80 magazines = 107 items in one bookshelf

Now we know that each bookshelf has 107 items, but we want to know how many of those items are books. We can use a proportion to find out:

27 books / 107 items = x books / 1 bookshelf

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

27 books * 1 bookshelf = 107 items * x books

27 books = 107 items * x books / 1 bookshelf

27 books = 107x books

x = 27 books / 107

x = 0.2523 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, in one bookshelf, Bryan has approximately 0.2523 * 107 = 27 books.

Finally, to find out how many books he has in total, we can multiply the number of books in one bookshelf by the number of bookshelves:

27 books per bookshelf * 23 bookshelves = 621 books in total

Therefore, Bryan has 621 books in total. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",621,False,False

"The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?",58.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches. 

Next, we need to find out how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper. We're told that the frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can add 39 to 19: 

19 + 39 = 58 

So the frog jumped 58 inches. 

Finally, we need to find out how much less the mouse jumped than the frog. We're told that the mouse jumped 94 inches less than the frog, so we can subtract 94 from 58: 

58 - 94 = -36 

Uh oh, that doesn't make sense! How can the mouse jump a negative distance? 

We made a mistake earlier when we added 39 to 19. We should have added 39 to the total distance the grasshopper jumped, not just to the 19 inches. So let's start over: 

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. 

The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we add 39 to 19: 

19 + 39 = 58 

So the frog jumped 58 inches. 

The mouse jumped 94 inches less than the frog, so we subtract 94 from 58: 

58 - 94 = -36 

Wait, we still got a negative number! That means the mouse didn't jump at all, or maybe even went backwards. 

Let's check our work. We know that the frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the total distance the frog jumped should be: 

19 + 39 = 58 

That checks out. 

But then we're told that the mouse jumped 94 inches less than the frog. If the frog jumped 58 inches, then the mouse should have jumped: 

58 - 94 = -36 

Uh oh, we made another mistake. We should have subtracted 94 from the distance the grasshopper jumped, not the frog. 

So let's start over again: 

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. 

The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we add 39 to 19: 

19 + 39 = 58 

So the frog jumped 58 inches. 

The mouse jumped 94 inches less than the grasshopper, so we subtract 94 from 19: 

19 - 94 Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","-75. 

So the mouse jumped 75 inches less than the grasshopper. 

To summarize: 

- Grasshopper jumped 19 inches 
- Frog jumped 58 inches 
- Mouse jumped 75 inches less than the grasshopper (or -75 inches)",False,False

5. To do this calculation, we need to first find out the average number of visitors per day in the past 327 days. We can do this by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days:

    Average visitors per day = Total visitors / Number of days
                            = 406 / 327
                            = 1.24 (rounded to two decimal places)

6. Now we can use this average to estimate the number of visitors on the previous day. Let's call this number ""x"":

    x + 132 = 2.48   (since the average is 1.24 visitors per day for the past 327 days)
    x = 2.48 - 132
    x = -129.52

7. This result doesn't make sense, because we can't have negative visitors. So, we need to adjust our calculation. One possibility is that the number of visitors on Rachel's day was significantly higher or lower than the average. Let's assume that it was higher, say 150 visitors. Then we can recalculate:

    Total visitors in the past 327 days - Visitors on Rachel's day = Visitors on the previous day
    406 - 150 = 256

So, we estimate that there were 256 visitors on the previous day. However, this is just an estimate based on assumptions. Without more information, we can't be sure of the exact number. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",256,False,False

How many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of campers who went rowing.

To find the total number of campers who went rowing, we need to add the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon.

Number of campers who went rowing = 29 (morning) + 26 (afternoon) = 55

Step 2: Find the difference between the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and the afternoon.

To find the difference between the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon from the number of campers who went rowing in the morning.

Difference = 29 (morning) - 26 (afternoon) = 3

Therefore, 3 more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3,False,False

"Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines after 57 stops. He was told by 252 of the pickers that they fill 108 drums of grapes per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days?",6264.0,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,sbs,"Q: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines after 57 stops. He was told by 252 of the pickers that they fill 108 drums of grapes per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pickers there are in total. We know that 252 pickers told him about the grape production, but we don't know if that's all of them. Let's assume that all the pickers told him, so:

Total number of pickers = 252

Next, we need to find out how many drums of grapes are filled in one day by all the pickers. We know that 108 drums are filled by the 252 pickers, so we can set up a proportion:

108 drums / 252 pickers = x drums / total number of pickers

Solving for x, we get:

x = (108 drums / 252 pickers) * total number of pickers
x = (108/252) * 252
x = 108 drums

So, all the pickers fill 108 drums of grapes per day.

Finally, we can find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days. Since we know that 108 drums are filled in one day, we can multiply that by the number of days:

Total drums of grapes = 108 drums/day * 58 days
Total drums of grapes = 6,264 drums

Therefore, in 58 days, the pickers would fill 6,264 drums of grapes. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","6,264.00",False,False

He needs a total of 57 g of colors to paint them. He needs 22 g of wax more. If the feathers require a total of 353 g of wax How many grams of wax does he already have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that he needs 22 g of wax more than what he currently has. So let's call the amount of wax he currently has ""x"". 

x + 22 = total amount of wax needed 

Next, we know that the feathers require a total of 353 g of wax. So we can set up an equation: 

x + 22 + 353 = total amount of wax 

Simplifying: 

x + 375 = total amount of wax 

Finally, we want to solve for ""x"", which represents the amount of wax he already has: 

x = total amount of wax - 375 

We don't know the exact total amount of wax, but we do know that he needs a total of 57 g of colors to paint the feathers. So let's call the total amount of wax and colors combined ""y"": 

x + 57 = y 

Substituting the previous equation for ""x"": 

total amount of wax - 375 + 57 = y 

Simplifying: 

total amount of wax - 318 = y

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far the frog jumped. Since the frog jumped 18 inches farther than the grasshopper, we can add 18 inches to the grasshopper's jump distance:

25 inches (grasshopper) + 18 inches = 43 inches (frog)

Now, we need to find out how far the mouse jumped. Since the mouse jumped 2 inches farther than the frog, we can add 2 inches to the frog's jump distance:

43 inches (frog) + 2 inches = 45 inches (mouse)

So, the mouse jumped 45 inches. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",45,False,False

How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Steven has 4 peaches. Since Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill, we can write this as:

Steven's peaches = Jill's peaches + 11

Now we can plug in the number of peaches Steven has:

4 = Jill's peaches + 11

To find out how many peaches Jill has, we can subtract 11 from both sides of the equation:

4 - 11 = Jill's peaches

So, Jill has -7 peaches. (This doesn't make sense in reality, but let's continue with the problem.)

Now, we know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. We can write this as:

Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 12

We can plug in the number of peaches Steven has:

Jake's peaches = 4 - 12

So, Jake has -8 peaches.

Finally, we want to find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake. We can write this as:

Difference = Jill's peaches - Jake's peaches

Plugging in the values we found:

Difference = -7 - (-8)

Difference = -7 + 8

Difference = 1

So, Jill has 1 more peach than Jake. However, since it's impossible to have a negative number of peaches, this problem doesn't make sense in reality. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1,False,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, you mentioned that you read 14 of the movies and watched 19 of the books. However, it should be the other way around: you read 14 of the books and watched 19 of the movies. But there are only 10 books and 6 movies in the series. So, you must have read all 10 books and watched all 6 movies.

Now, to find out how many more books than movies you have read, we simply subtract the number of movies from the number of books:

10 books - 6 movies = 4

So, you have read 4 more books than movies in the 'crazy silly school' series. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4,False,False

Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages. It took frank 664 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?,332.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages. It took frank 664 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pages are in the book. Since there are 2 chapters with 405 pages each, we can calculate the total number of pages by multiplying the number of chapters by the number of pages per chapter:

Total pages = 2 chapters * 405 pages/chapter = 810 pages

Now, we know that Frank took 664 days to finish the book. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days:

Chapters per day = Total pages / Days = 810 pages / 664 days ≈ 1.22 pages/day

Since there are 405 pages in each chapter, we can now find out how many chapters Frank read per day:

Chapters per day = Pages per day / Pages per chapter = 1.22 pages/day / 405 pages/chapter ≈ 0.003 chapters/day

So, Frank read approximately 0.003 chapters per day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",0.003.,False,False

After selling some in a garage sale he bought 38 new ones. If he has 116 books now How many more books did he buy than he sold?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many books Paul sold. We know that he had 71 books and now has 116 books after buying 38 new ones. So, we can write an equation:

71 - number_of_books_sold + 38 = 116

Now, we need to solve for the number_of_books_sold. We can start by combining the numbers:

71 + 38 = 109

So, the equation becomes:

109 - number_of_books_sold = 116

Now, we can subtract 109 from both sides of the equation to find the number_of_books_sold:

number_of_books_sold = 116 - 109

number_of_books_sold = 7

Now we know that Paul sold 7 books. We also know that he bought 38 new books. To find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we can subtract the number of books he sold from the number of books he bought:

38 - 7 = 31

How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many push-ups David did. Since he did 39 more than Zachary, we can write the equation: 

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 39

Now we know that Zachary did 15 push-ups, so we can plug that into the equation:

David's push-ups = 15 + 39

David's push-ups = 54

Now we need to find out how many push-ups John did. Since he did 9 less than David, we can write the equation:

John's push-ups = David's push-ups - 9

We know that David did 54 push-ups, so we can plug that into the equation:

John's push-ups = 54 - 9

John's push-ups = 45

Now we can find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John. We can write the equation:

More push-ups = Zachary's push-ups - John's push-ups

We know that Zachary did 15 push-ups and John did 45 push-ups, so we can plug those numbers into the equation:

More push-ups = 15 - 45

More push-ups = -30

Since the result is negative, that means Zachary actually did 30 fewer push-ups than John. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",30,True,False
Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug.

How many marbles did Doug lose?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's represent the number of marbles Doug had originally as D and the number of marbles Ed had originally as E. We know that Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so we can write this as:

E = D + 2

Now, Doug lost some marbles, and Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. Let's represent the number of marbles Doug has now as D' and the number of marbles Ed has now as E'. We know that E' = D' + 19.

However, Ed didn't lose any marbles, so E = E'. Similarly, the number of marbles Doug had originally (D) minus the number of marbles he lost (L) is equal to the number of marbles he has now (D'), so D - L = D'.

Now we can substitute E for E' and D - L for D' in the equation E' = D' + 19:

E = (D - L) + 19

We also know that E = D + 2, so we can substitute D + 2 for E in the equation above:

D + 2 = (D - L) + 19

Now we can solve for L:

D + 2 = D - L + 19
L = D - D + 19 - 2
L = 17

So Doug lost 17 marbles. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",17,False,False

Now he has 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers in his collection. How many more wrappers than bottle caps does danny have now?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps and wrappers Danny had before he found the new ones at the park. To do this, we can subtract the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found from the total number he has now.

For bottle caps:
27 (total bottle caps now) - 10 (bottle caps found at the park) = 17 (bottle caps before)

For wrappers:
43 (total wrappers now) - 62 (wrappers found at the park) = -19 (wrappers before)

Now we know that Danny had 17 bottle caps and -19 wrappers before. However, having a negative number of wrappers doesn't make sense. So, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or the numbers given.

Assuming that the numbers given are correct, we can still find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny has now.

To do this, we can subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers:

43 (total wrappers now) - 27 (total bottle caps now) = 16

So, Danny has 16 more wrappers than bottle caps now. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",16,True,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, Haley wants to keep 15 marbles for herself. So, we need to find out how many marbles she will give away. To do this, we subtract the number of marbles she wants to keep from the total number of marbles she has:

23 marbles (total) - 15 marbles (for herself) = 8 marbles (to give away) Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","8 marbles (to give away)

Now, we know that there are 4 boys who love to play marbles. So, we need to divide the number of marbles to give away by the number of boys:

8 marbles (to give away) ÷ 4 boys = 2 marbles per boy

So, each of the boys will receive 2 marbles.",False,False
Matthew had 22 crackers and 34 cakes.

There are 46 school buses and a total of 92 students in the school. If all buses are full How many seats are in each bus?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in each classroom. To do this, we can divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms:

92 students / 17 classrooms = 5.41 students per classroom (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, let's round up to 6 students per classroom. This means there are a total of 6 students * 17 classrooms = 102 students in the school.

Now, we need to find out how many seats are in each bus. To do this, we can divide the total number of students by the number of buses:

102 students / 46 buses = 2.22 seats per bus (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a seat, let's round up to 3 seats per bus. This means there are a total of 3 seats * 46 buses = 138 seats on all the buses.

However, we made some rounding errors in our calculations, so the actual number of seats per bus might be slightly different. To get a more accurate answer, we can divide the total number of seats by the number of buses:

138 seats / 46 buses = 3 seats per bus

So, there are 3 seats in each bus. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3,False,False

Now he has 67 wrappers and 35 bottle caps in his collection. How many more wrappers than bottle caps does danny have now?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps and wrappers Danny had before he found the new ones at the park. To do this, we can subtract the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found from his current collection.

For bottle caps:
35 (current collection) - 15 (found at the park) = 20 (before finding new ones)

For wrappers:
67 (current collection) - 18 (found at the park) = 49 (before finding new ones)

Now we can find the difference between the number of wrappers and bottle caps in his current collection.

67 (wrappers) - 35 (bottle caps) = 32

So, Danny has 32 more wrappers than bottle caps in his collection now. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",32,True,False

After selling some in a garage sale he bought 42 new ones. If he has 15 books now How many more books did he sell than he bought?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many books Paul had after selling some in the garage sale. To do this, we can use the information that he bought 42 new books and now has 15 books. So, we can write the equation:

Books after garage sale + 42 = 15

Now, we can solve for the number of books after the garage sale:

Books after garage sale = 15 - 42 = -27

Since it's impossible to have a negative number of books, this means that Paul actually sold more books than he bought. So, let's change the equation to:

Books after garage sale - 42 = 15

Now, we can solve for the number of books after the garage sale:

Books after garage sale = 15 + 42 = 57

Now that we know Paul had 57 books after the garage sale, we can find out how many books he sold. We know that he started with 21 books, so we can write the equation:

21 - Books sold = 57

Now, we can solve for the number of books sold:

Books sold = 21 - 57 = -36

Since it's impossible to sell a negative number of books, this means that Paul actually sold 36 more books than he bought. So, the answer is 36. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",36,False,False

She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 376 Ace cards and 111 baseball cards left. How many more Ace cards than baseball cards does Nell have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cards Nell had in total before giving some to Jeff. To do this, we add the number of baseball cards and Ace cards she had: 239 baseball cards + 38 Ace cards = <<239+38=277>>277 cards.

Now, we need to find out how many cards Nell has left after giving some to Jeff. To do this, we add the number of baseball cards and Ace cards she has left: 111 baseball cards + 376 Ace cards = <<111+376=487>>487 cards.

Next, we need to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. To do this, we subtract the number of cards she has left from the number of cards she had before: 277 cards - 487 cards = -210 cards. Since the result is negative, it means that Nell actually received cards from Jeff, not gave them to him. So, Nell received 210 cards from Jeff.

Now, we need to find out how many more Ace cards than baseball cards Nell has. To do this, we subtract the number of baseball cards she has left from the number of Ace cards she has left: 376 Ace cards - 111 baseball cards = <<376-111=265>>265 more Ace cards. 

So, Nell has 265 more Ace cards than baseball cards. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",265,False,False

How many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many push-ups and crunches David did. We know that David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can write that as:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 38
David's push-ups = 46 + 38
David's push-ups = 84

Now, we know that David did 62 less crunches than Zachary, so we can write that as:

David's crunches = Zachary's crunches - 62
David's crunches = 58 - 62
David's crunches = -4

However, it doesn't make sense for David to do a negative number of crunches. There might be an error in the problem statement or we might have misunderstood the question. Assuming the problem statement is correct, let's continue with the given information.

Now, we need to find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did. We can write that as:

More crunches = Zachary's crunches - Zachary's push-ups
More crunches = 58 - 46
More crunches = 12

So, Zachary did 12 more crunches than push-ups. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",12,True,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, the waiter had 3 customers. Then, some left, and he still had 4 customers. This means that more customers must have arrived after the initial 3. Let's call the number of customers who left L and the number of customers who arrived A. We know that:

3 - L + A = 4

We want to find the difference between the number of customers who stayed behind (4) and those who left (L). So, we need to find the value of (4 - L).

From the equation above, we can see that:

A - L = 1

Now, we don't have enough information to determine the exact number of customers who left and arrived. However, we can say that one more customer stayed behind than those who left, as (A - L) = 1. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1,False,False

If he had 32 crackers and 98 cakes initially How many crackers did each person eat?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crackers and cakes Matthew had in total. He had 32 crackers and 98 cakes, so he had 32 + 98 = <<32+98=130>>130 crackers and cakes combined.

Now, we know that he gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends. So, we can divide the total number of crackers and cakes by 2 to find out how many of each he gave away. He gave away 130 / 2 = <<130/2=65>>65 crackers and 65 cakes.

Since he gave these to 4 friends, we can divide the number of crackers by 4 to find out how many crackers each friend received. Each friend received 65 / 4 = <<65/4=16.25>>16.25 crackers.

However, it's not possible to give away a fraction of a cracker, so we need to adjust our numbers. Let's try giving away one less cracker and one more cake. This would mean he gave away 64 crackers and 66 cakes, which still adds up to 130.

The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar How many more cups of flour does she need to add?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Mary still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. Let x be the number of cups of sugar she still needs to add. Then, the number of cups of flour she still needs to add is x + 8.

Now, we know that the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. Since she already put in some cups of flour, let's say she put in y cups of flour. Then, she still needs to add (6 - y) cups of flour.

We can now set up an equation:

x + 8 = 6 - y

We also know that she still needs to add x cups of sugar, so:

x = 13 - x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 6.5

Now, we can plug this value back into the equation for the number of cups of flour she still needs to add:

x + 8 = 6.5 + 8 = 14.5

So, Mary still needs to add 14.5 more cups of flour. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",14.5.,False,False

Nell collects cards. She had 438 baseball cards and 18 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 55 Ace cards and 178 baseball cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?,123.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: Nell collects cards. She had 438 baseball cards and 18 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 55 Ace cards and 178 baseball cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. To do this, we can subtract the number of cards she has left from the number of cards she had before.

For baseball cards, she had 438 and now has 178 left, so she gave away 438 - 178 = <<438-178=260>>260 baseball cards.

For Ace cards, she had 18 and now has 55 left, so she gave away 18 - 55 = -37 Ace cards. Since it's not possible to give away a negative number of cards, this means that she actually received 37 Ace cards from someone else.

Now we can find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has. She has 178 baseball cards and 55 Ace cards, so she has 178 - 55 = <<178-55=123>>123 more baseball cards than Ace cards. Answer: \boxed{123}. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",123,False,False
Matthew had 24 crackers.

If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends and still had 17 crackers left How many crackers did Matthew give to his friends?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crackers Matthew gave away in total. To do this, we subtract the number of crackers he has left (17) from the total number of crackers he had (24). So, 24 - 17 = 7 crackers.

Now, we know that Matthew gave away 7 crackers in total, and he gave an equal number of crackers to each of his 3 friends. To find out how many crackers each friend received, we simply divide the total number of crackers given away (7) by the number of friends (3). So, 7 ÷ 3 = 2.33 crackers.

However, since it's not possible to give away a fraction of a cracker, we can conclude that Matthew gave 2 crackers to two of his friends and 3 crackers to the third friend. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","2, 2, 3",False,False

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the mouse jump?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far the frog jumped. Since the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, we can write the equation:

Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - 19 inches

Now we can plug in the grasshopper's jump:

Frog's jump = 39 inches - 19 inches

Frog's jump = 20 inches

Now we know the frog jumped 20 inches. Since the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog, we can write the equation:

Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 12 inches

Now we can plug in the frog's jump:

Mouse's jump = 20 inches - 12 inches

Mouse's jump = 8 inches

So the mouse jumped 8 inches. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8,True,False

There, Rachel learned that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If 829 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 829 people visited the palace within the past 85 days. We also know that 45 visitors came on the previous day. So, we need to find out how many visitors visited the palace on the current day.

To do this, we can subtract the number of visitors from the previous day (45) from the total number of visitors in the past 85 days (829).

829 - 45 = 784

Now, we know that 784 visitors visited the palace in the past 84 days (since we have removed the previous day's visitors). To find out how many visitors visited the palace on the current day, we can divide the total number of visitors in the past 84 days by 84.

784 / 84 = 9.3333

Since we cannot have a fraction of a visitor, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. In this case, it would be 9 visitors.

So, 9 visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9,False,False

Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together and colors to paint them. He needs a total of 57 g of colors to paint them. He needs 22 g of wax more. If the feathers require a total of 353 g of wax How many grams of wax does he already have?,331.0,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q: Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together and colors to paint them. He needs a total of 57 g of colors to paint them. He needs 22 g of wax more. If the feathers require a total of 353 g of wax How many grams of wax does he already have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that he needs 22 g more wax than he currently has. So, let's represent the amount of wax he already has as x. Then, x + 22 g is the total amount of wax he needs, which is 353 g.

Now, we can write the equation: x + 22 = 353

To solve for x, we can subtract 22 from both sides of the equation: x = 353 - 22

Now, we can calculate the value of x: x = 331

So, he already has 331 g of wax. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",331,True,False
