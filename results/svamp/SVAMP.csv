How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?,2.0,sbs,"Q: 28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Initially, there were 28 children on the bus.
2. At the bus stop, 82 children got on the bus, so the total number of children on the bus became 28 + 82 = 110.
3. Let's say x children got off the bus at the next stop.
4. Therefore, the number of children on the bus after some got off became 110 - x.
5. According to the problem, there were 30 children on the bus after some got off. So we can write an equation:
110 - x = 30
6. Solving for x, we get:
x = 80
7. This means 80 children got off the bus at the next stop.
8. Finally, we can calculate how many more children got on the bus than those that got off:
82 - 80 = 2
Therefore, 2 more children got on the bus than those that got off. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2

How much more money did she collect at the atm than she spent at the supermarket?,46.0,sbs,"Q: There were 3 dollars in Olivia's wallet. She collected 49 more dollars from an atm. After she visited a supermarket there were 49 dollars left. How much more money did she collect at the atm than she spent at the supermarket?

A: Let's think step by step. Olivia started with 3 dollars in her wallet. 

She collected 49 more dollars from an ATM, so she had a total of 3 + 49 = 52 dollars. 

After she visited a supermarket, she had 49 dollars left. This means she spent 52 - 49 = 3 dollars at the supermarket. 

To find out how much more money she collected at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket, we need to subtract the amount she spent at the supermarket from the amount she collected at the ATM: 

49 - 3 = 46 

Therefore, Olivia collected 46 more dollars at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",46

How many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many birds were sitting on the fence before the new arrivals. We know that there were 3 birds sitting on the fence.

Next, we need to add the new arrivals. We know that 6 more storks and 2 more birds came to join them. So, we add 6 storks and 2 birds to the original 3 birds:

3 + 6 + 2 = 11

Now we know that there are 11 birds and storks sitting on the fence.

Finally, we need to find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence. To do this, we need to subtract the number of birds from the number of storks:

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's start by finding the number of boys in the school. We know that there are 458 fewer boys than girls, so we can set up an equation:

number of girls = number of boys + 458

2. We also know that there are 692 girls in the school, so we can substitute that into the equation:

692 = number of boys + 458

3. Now we can solve for the number of boys:

692 - 458 = number of boys

234 = number of boys

4. Finally, we can find the total number of pupils in the school by adding the number of boys and girls:

total number of pupils = number of boys + number of girls

total number of pupils = 234 + 692

total number of pupils = 926

Therefore, there are 926 pupils in the school. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",926

- 4 more birds came to join them, so now there are 6 + 4 = 10 birds on the fence.
- 8 more storks also came to join them, but the question only asks about the number of birds, not storks. So we can ignore the storks for now.
- Therefore, the answer is 10 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10
gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 36 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?,16.0,sbs,"Q: Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 36 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed 36 pounds.
2. On the way back, his dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries.
3. Marco's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds.
4. We need to find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed now.

To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's call the weight of his dad's strawberries ""x"". Then we can set up an equation:

x + 12 = 36 - 8

The left side of the equation represents the total weight of strawberries after his dad lost 8 pounds and Marco's strawberries weighed 12 pounds. The right side of the equation represents the original weight of all the strawberries they collected, minus the 8 pounds his dad lost.

Now we can simplify and solve for x:

x + 12 = 28
x = 16

So his dad's strawberries weighed 16 pounds after he lost 8 pounds on the way back. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",16
gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,In a school there are 697 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 228 more girls than boys How many boys are there in that school?,469.0,sbs,"Q: In a school there are 697 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 228 more girls than boys How many boys are there in that school?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that there are 697 girls in the school.
2. We also know that there are 228 more girls than boys.
3. Let's use ""x"" to represent the number of boys in the school.
4. According to step 2, the number of girls is x + 228.
5. We know that the total number of students in the school is the sum of the number of girls and the number of boys. Therefore, we can write an equation: 

x + (x + 228) = total number of students

6. We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: 

2x + 228 = total number of students

7. We don't know the total number of students, but we don't need to know it to solve for x. We just need to use the information we have to isolate x. 

8. Let's start by subtracting 228 from both sides of the equation: 

2x = total number of students - 228

9. Now we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for x: 

x = (total number of students - 228) / 2

10. We still don't know the total number of students, but we can use the fact that there are 697 girls to find it. 

11. We know that the total number of students is the sum of the number of girls and the number of boys: 

total number of students = 697 + x

12. We can substitute the expression we found for x in step 9: 

total number of students = 697 + (total number of students - 228) / 2

13. Now we can solve for the total number of students: 

2(total number of students) = 1394 + total number of students - 228

14. Simplifying this equation: 

total number of students = 1163

15. Finally, we can use this value to find the number of boys: 

x = (total number of students - 228) / 2 = (1163 - 228) / 2 = 467

Therefore, there are 467 boys in the school. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",467
gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,In a school there are 732 girls and 761 boys. 682 more girls and 8 more boys joined the school. How many girls are there in the school now?,1414.0,sbs,"Q: In a school there are 732 girls and 761 boys. 682 more girls and 8 more boys joined the school. How many girls are there in the school now?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we add the initial number of girls and boys: 

732 + 761 = 1493 

Next, we add the number of new girls and boys: 

682 + 8 = 690 

Now, we add the two totals to get the new total number of students: 

1493 + 690 = 2183 

Finally, we subtract the initial number of boys from the new total to get the new number of girls: 

2183 - 769 = 1414 

Therefore, there are 1414 girls in the school now. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1414

2. Now he has 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers in his collection, so he had 17+57 = 74 bottle caps and wrappers.
3. To find out how many wrappers Danny had at first, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps from the total number of bottle caps and wrappers he had at first: 

    Total - Bottle caps = Wrappers at first
    52 + (Wrappers at first) - 17 = 74
    (Wrappers at first) + 35 = 74
    (Wrappers at first) = 39

Therefore, Danny had 39 wrappers at first. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",39

If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 suggested adding bacon. 

So the total number of students who suggested either mashed potatoes or bacon is: 

450 + 38 = 488 

Now, we need to find out how many students did not suggest either mashed potatoes or bacon. 

We know that there were a total of 66 choices, and we already accounted for 2 of them (mashed potatoes and bacon). 

So the number of choices that were not suggested is: 

66 - 2 = 64 

Therefore, the number of students who did not participate in suggesting new food items is: 

64 - 488 = -424 

Wait a minute, that doesn't make sense! A negative number of students? 

This means that there must be an error in the problem statement. Perhaps the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes was supposed to be 350 instead of 450. 

Let's assume that's the case. 

Then the total number of students who suggested either mashed potatoes or bacon is: 

350 + 38 = 388 

And the number of students who did not participate is: 

64 - 388 = -324 

Still a negative number. 

Let's try another assumption. Perhaps the total number of choices was supposed to be 76 instead of 66. 

Then the number of choices that were not suggested is: 

76 - 2 = 74 

And the number of students who did not participate is: 

74 - 488 = -414 

Another negative number. 

At this point, we can conclude that there is no way to solve this problem with the given information. We need to know either the total number of students who participated or the percentage of students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",not possible to determine.

If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends, so he gave each friend the same amount of crackers and cakes.
2. We need to find out how many crackers and cakes each person ate, so we need to divide the total number of crackers and cakes by the number of friends.
3. The total number of crackers and cakes is 13 + 15 = 28.
4. Matthew had 28 friends, so each person received 28/28 = 1 cracker and 1 cake.
5. Therefore, each person ate 1 cracker and 1 cake. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1 cracker and 1 cake per person.

gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,There were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. How many roses did she cut?,2.0,sbs,"Q: There were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. How many roses did she cut?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the difference in the number of roses and orchids between the two situations.

In the first situation, there were 15 roses and 62 orchids, so the total number of flowers in the vase was:

15 + 62 = 77

In the second situation, there are 17 roses and 96 orchids, so the total number of flowers in the vase is:

17 + 96 = 113

The difference between these two situations is:

113 - 77 = 36

Step 2: Determine how many of the additional flowers are roses.

We know that Jessica added some more roses and orchids to the vase. Let's say she added r roses and o orchids. Then we can write:

r + o = 36

But we don't know how many of the additional flowers are roses and how many are orchids. However, we do know that the total number of roses in the vase increased by:

17 - 15 = 2

So Jessica must have added 2 more roses to the vase. Therefore, we can write:

r = 2

Step 3: Solve for the number of orchids Jessica added.

We can use the equation we wrote in step 2 to solve for o:

r + o = 36

2 + o = 36

o = 36 - 2

o = 34

Therefore, Jessica added 2 more roses and 34 more orchids to the vase. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",Jessica cut 13 roses.

David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did 35 + 58 = 93 push-ups. 

David also did 87 less crunches than Zachary, so he did 3 - 87 = -84 crunches. 

Wait a minute, how can David do negative crunches? That doesn't make sense. 

Let's go back and check our work. We made a mistake when we subtracted 87 from 3. It should be 3 - 87 = -84.

2. He added some more action figures to the shelf.
3. He removed 10 of the old ones.
4. Now there are 8 action figures on the shelf.

To find out how many action figures Jerry added to the shelf, we need to work backwards. 

First, we know that after removing 10 old action figures, there were still some left on the shelf. So, we can say:

8 (current number of action figures) + 10 (old ones removed) = total number of action figures before removal

This gives us:

18 = total number of action figures before removal

Next, we know that Jerry started with 7 action figures before adding any more. So, we can say:

total number of action figures before removal - 7 (original ones) = number of action figures added

This gives us:

18 - 7 = 11

Therefore, Jerry added 11 more action figures to the shelf. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",11

How many kids did she play with altogether?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Julia played tag with 12 kids on Monday and 14 kids on Tuesday, so she played with a total of 12 + 14 = 26 kids.
2. We know that she spent a total of 34 hours playing tag on both days. Let's call the time she spent playing tag on Monday ""x"" and the time she spent playing tag on Tuesday ""y"". So we have:
x + y = 34
3. We don't know the exact values of x and y, but we can use another piece of information to find them. We know that Julia played with 12 kids on Monday and 14 kids on Tuesday, so the total number of kids she played with is the sum of the number of kids she played with on each day. In other words:
12x + 14y = total number of kids she played with
4. We already know that the total number of kids she played with is 26, so we can substitute that into the equation above:
12x + 14y = 26
5. Now we have two equations with two unknowns:
x + y = 34
12x + 14y = 26
6. We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can solve for x:
x = 34 - y
7. Now we can substitute this expression for x into the second equation:
12(34 - y) + 14y = 26
8. Simplifying this equation, we get:
408 - 12y + 14y = 26
2y = -382
y = -191
9. This doesn't make sense, since we can't have negative time. We made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back to step 6 and solve for y instead:
y = 34 - x
10. Now we can substitute this expression for y into the second equation:
12x + 14(34 - x) = 26
11. Simplifying this equation, we get:
12x + 476 - 14x = 26
-2x = -450
x = 225
12. Now we can use either equation to solve for y:
y = 34 - x = 34 - 225 = -191
13. Again, this doesn't make sense. We made another mistake somewhere. Let's go Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",not possible to determine.

She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards.
2. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so let's say she gave x baseball cards and y Ace cards.
3. After giving some cards to Jeff, Nell has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. So we can write an equation: 

309 - x + 356 - y = 415 

4. We want to find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has. So we need to subtract the number of Ace cards from the number of baseball cards: 

415 - 356 = 59 

5. To solve for x and y, we can simplify the equation we wrote in step 3: 

665 - x - y = 415 

6. Subtract 665 from both sides: 

-x - y = -250 

7. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other: 

x = -y + 250 

8. Now we can substitute this expression for x into the equation in step 3: 

309 - (-y + 250) + 356 - y = 415 

9. Simplify: 

-y + 250 - y = 415 - 309 - 356 

-2y + 250 = -50 

10. Solve for y: 

y = 150 

11. Now we can use this value of y to find x: 

x = -y + 250 = -150 + 250 = 100 

12. Finally, we can check our answer by verifying that Nell has 59 more baseball cards than Ace cards: 

415 - 356 = 59 

So Nell has 59 more baseball cards than Ace cards. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",59

There were 89 bird families living near the mountain. If 60 bird families flew away for winter How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many bird families stayed behind.
To do this, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the total number of bird families living near the mountain.
Total number of bird families = 89
Number of bird families that flew away = 60
Number of bird families that stayed behind = 89 - 60 = 29

Step 2: Find out how many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind.
To do this, we need to subtract the number of bird families that stayed behind from the number of bird families that flew away.
Number of bird families that flew away = 60
Number of bird families that stayed behind = 29

Number of roses after cutting = 3
Number of orchids after cutting = 13

Step 4: Find the values of x and y.

From step 2 and step 3, we can write two equations:

9 + x = 3
6 + y = 13

Solving for x and y, we get:

x = -6
y = 7

4. We don't know the value of x, but we can write an equation to solve for it. The equation is:

x - 22 = the number of crackers Matthew has now

5. We don't know the number of crackers Matthew has now, but we do know that he gave away 2 crackers to each of his 11 friends. So, we can write another equation:

the number of crackers Matthew has now = x - 2 x 11

6. Now we can substitute this expression for ""the number of crackers Matthew has now"" into the first equation:

x - 22 = x - 2 x 11

7. Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

x - 22 = x - 22

8. We can see that the equation is true for any value of x. This means that we can't determine the initial number of crackers Matthew had from the information given in the problem. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",indeterminate.

He found out that they harvest 38 sacks per day and that each sack containes 42 oranges. How many sacks of oranges will they have after 49 days of harvest?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many oranges they harvest per day:

38 sacks/day x 42 oranges/sack = 1596 oranges/day

Next, we need to find out how many oranges they will harvest in 49 days:

1596 oranges/day x 49 days = 78,204 oranges

Finally, we need to find out how many sacks of oranges that is:

gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,There were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. How many orchids did she cut?,4.0,sbs,"Q: There were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. How many orchids did she cut?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with the initial number of roses and orchids in the vase.

Initial number of roses = 16
Initial number of orchids = 3

Step 2: Add the number of roses and orchids Jessica cut from her garden.

Let's say Jessica cut x number of roses and y number of orchids.

New number of roses = 16 + x
New number of orchids = 3 + y

Step 3: Use the information given in the problem to form an equation.

According to the problem, there are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. So we can write:

New number of orchids = 7
New number of roses = 13

Step 4: Solve for x and y.

From Step 2, we know:

New number of roses = 16 + x
New number of orchids = 3 + y

Substituting the values from Step 3, we get:

7 = 3 + y
13 = 16 + x

Solving for y, we get:

y = 4

Solving for x, we get:

x = -3

Step 5: Check the answer.

We can check our answer by verifying that the new number of roses and orchids in the vase add up to the total number of flowers Jessica cut from her garden.

New number of roses = 16 + x = 16 - 3 = 13
New number of orchids = 3 + y = 3 + 4 = 7

Total number of flowers Jessica cut = x + y = -3 + 4 = 1

13 + 7 = 20
20 + 1 = 21

The total number of flowers Jessica cut from her garden is not equal to the sum of the new number of roses and orchids in the vase. This means our answer is incorrect.

Step 6: Correct the answer.

Since the total number of flowers Jessica cut is not equal to the sum of the new number of roses and orchids in the vase, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back to Step 4 and check our work.

7 = 3 + y
13 = 16 + x

Solving for y, we get:

y = 4

Solving for x, we get:

x = -3

We made a mistake in solving for x. The correct value Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",":

Jessica cut 4 orchids."

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out the depth of the water. We know that it is 10 times Dean's height, which is 9 feet. So:

Depth of water = 10 x Dean's height
Depth of water = 10 x 9 feet
Depth of water = 90 feet

Now we can answer the question. We need to find out how much deeper the water is than Dean's height, which is 9 feet. So:

Depth of water - Dean's height = 90 feet - 9 feet

How much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that Marco and his dad's strawberries together weighed 4 pounds.
2. We also know that Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds.
3. To find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's, we need to subtract his dad's strawberries from the total weight of their strawberries.
4. We can set up an equation: 

    Marco's strawberries - Dad's strawberries = Difference

    19 - Dad's strawberries = Difference

5. We can simplify this equation by subtracting 19 from both sides:

    -Dad's strawberries = Difference - 19

6. We can simplify further by multiplying both sides by -1 to get rid of the negative sign:

    Dad's strawberries = 19 - Difference

7. Now we can substitute this equation into the original equation:

    Marco's strawberries - (19 - Difference) = Difference

8. We can simplify this equation by distributing the negative sign:

    Marco's strawberries - 19 + Difference = Difference

9. We can simplify further by adding 19 to both sides:

    Marco's strawberries + Difference = 2 * Difference

10. We can simplify even further by subtracting Marco's strawberries from both sides:

    Difference = 19 - Marco's strawberries

11. Now we can substitute in the value we know for Marco's strawberries:

    Difference = 19 - 19 = 0

12. Therefore, Marco's strawberries weighed the same as his dad's strawberries, and the difference is 0. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",0

How many more peaches does Jake have than Jill?,5.0,sbs,"Q: Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven who has 8 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 5 peaches. How many more peaches does Jake have than Jill?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that Steven has 5 peaches.
2. We also know that Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill. So, Jill must have 5 - 8 = -3 peaches. However, this doesn't make sense, as we can't have negative peaches. So, we need to re-think this step.
3. Let's try a different approach. We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven. So, if Steven has 5 peaches, then Jake must have 5 - 3 = 2 peaches.
4. We also know that Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill. So, if Steven has 5 peaches, then Jill must have 5 - 8 = -3 peaches. Again, this doesn't make sense, so we need to re-think this step.
5. Let's try another approach. We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven. We also know that Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill. So, if we add 3 to Jill's peaches, we can find out how many peaches Jake has compared to Jill. 
6. If Steven has 5 peaches, then Jill must have 5 - 8 = -3 peaches. Adding 3 to this gives us 0 peaches for Jill.
7. So, Jake has 2 peaches and Jill has 0 peaches. Therefore, Jake has 2 - 0 = 2 more peaches than Jill. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Steven has 12 peaches.
2. Steven has 67 more peaches than Jill. Let's call the number of peaches Jill has ""J"". So, Steven has J + 67 peaches.
3. Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven. So, Jake has J + 67 - 4 peaches.
4. We don't know the value of J, but we can use the information we have to create an equation. We know that Steven has 12 peaches, so J + 67 = 12. Solving for J, we get J = -55.
5. This doesn't make sense, as we can't have negative peaches. So, we made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.
6. We made a mistake in step 4. The equation should be J + 67 - 4 = 12. Solving for J, we get J = -51.
7. This still doesn't make sense, so we made another mistake. Let's go back and check our work again.
8. We made a mistake in step 2. It should say that Steven has 67 more peaches than Jill, not 67 more peaches than Steven. So, Steven has J + 67 peaches, and we don't know how many peaches Jill has.
9. Let's try again. Steven has 12 peaches, so J + 67 = 12. Solving for J, we get J = -55.
10. This still doesn't make sense, so we made another mistake. Let's go back and check our work again.
11. We made a mistake in step 2 again. It should say that Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, not 4 fewer peaches than Jill. So, Jake has J + 67 - 4 peaches.
12. Let's try again. Steven has 12 peaches, so J + 67 = 12. Solving for J, we get J = -55. Jake has J + 67 - 4 = -55 + 67 - 4 = 8 peaches.
13. Finally, we have our answer. Jake has 8 peaches. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8

gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,"Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework, 7 pages of reading homework and 3 more pages of biology homework. How many pages of math and biology homework did she have to complete?",11.0,sbs,"Q: Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework, 7 pages of reading homework and 3 more pages of biology homework. How many pages of math and biology homework did she have to complete?

A: Let's think step by step. Rachel had to complete:
- 8 pages of math homework
- 7 pages of reading homework
- 3 more pages of biology homework

To find out how many pages of math and biology homework she had to complete, we need to add the number of pages of math homework and the number of pages of biology homework.

Math homework: 8 pages
Biology homework: 3 more pages than the original amount, so we add 3 to the original amount of biology homework.

Original amount of biology homework + 3 = Total amount of biology homework

We don't know the original amount of biology homework, but we know that Rachel had to complete a total of 8 + 7 + (original amount of biology homework + 3) pages of homework.

So, we can write an equation:

8 + 7 + (original amount of biology homework + 3) = total amount of homework

Simplifying the equation:

18 + original amount of biology homework = total amount of homework

Now we need to isolate the original amount of biology homework:

original amount of biology homework = total amount of homework - 18

We don't know the total amount of homework, but we know that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework and some biology homework. So, we can write another equation:

total amount of homework = 8 + (original amount of biology homework + 3)

Substituting this into the previous equation:

original amount of biology homework = (8 + (original amount of biology homework + 3)) - 18

Simplifying:

original amount of biology homework = original amount of biology homework - 7

This equation doesn't make sense, because it says that the original amount of biology homework is equal to itself minus 7. So, we made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back to the beginning and try a different approach.

Rachel had to complete:
- 8 pages of math homework
- 7 pages of reading homework
- 3 more pages of biology homework

To find out how many pages of math and biology homework she had to complete, we can add the number of pages of math homework and the number of pages of biology homework:

Math homework: 8 pages
Biology homework: 3 more pages than the original amount

Let's call the original amount of biology homework ""x"". Then, the total amount of biology homework is ""x + 3"".

So, Rachel had to complete Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8 + (x + 3) = 11 + x pages of homework in math and biology.

How many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many birds were sitting on the fence before the others joined. The problem tells us that there were 2 birds on the fence.

Next, we need to add the 5 birds and 4 storks that came to join them. This gives us a total of 2 + 5 + 4 = 11 birds and storks on the fence.

Finally, we need to figure out how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence. We know that there were originally 2 birds, so there must be 11 - 2 = 9 birds that joined. Of those 9, 5 were birds and 4 were storks. Therefore, there are 5 - 4 = 1 more bird than storks sitting on the fence. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Paco had 6 cookies.
2. He gave 30 cookies to his friend, so he has 6 - 30 = -24 cookies left (negative because he gave away more than he had).
3. He also ate 23 cookies, so we need to subtract that from the negative number: -24 - 23 = -47.
4. Now we can answer the question: How many more cookies did he give to his friend than those he ate? He gave 30 cookies and ate 23, so the difference is 30 - 23 = 7.
5. Therefore, Paco gave his friend 7 more cookies than he ate. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",7

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We ordered 17 pizzas.
2. Each pizza has 4 slices.
3. So, the total number of slices of pizza is 17 x 4 = 68 slices.
4. There are 25 of us.
5. To find out how many slices of pizza each person gets, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 68 / 25 = 2.72 slices per person.
6. Since we can't have a fraction of a slice, we round down to 2 slices per person.
7. To find out how many slices of pizza are there altogether, we multiply the number of people by the number of slices per person: 25 x 2 = 50 slices.
8. Therefore, there are 50 slices of pizza altogether. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",50

There are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase. How many orchids did she cut?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with the initial number of roses and orchids in the vase.

Initial number of roses = 12
Initial number of orchids = 2

Step 2: Add the number of roses and orchids Jessica cut from her garden.

Let's say Jessica cut x roses and y orchids.

New number of roses = 12 + x
New number of orchids = 2 + y

Step 3: Use the information given in the problem to form equations.

From the problem, we know that after Jessica cut some more flowers, there are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase. So we can form two equations:

New number of roses = 10
New number of orchids = 21

Substituting the expressions we formed earlier, we get:

12 + x = 10
2 + y = 21

Simplifying each equation, we get:

x = -2
y = 19

Step 4: Check the answer.

It doesn't make sense for Jessica to have cut a negative number of roses, so we can ignore the first equation. However, it does make sense for her to have cut 19 orchids, since the initial number of orchids was only 2 and the final number is 21. Therefore, Jessica cut 19 orchids from her flower garden. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",19

How many packs of groceries did she buy in all?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that Lucy bought 2 packs of cookie and 12 packs of cake.
2. Let's find out how much money she spent on these groceries. We don't know the exact price of each pack, so let's call it ""x"". Therefore, she spent 2x on cookies and 12x on cakes.
3. The total amount she spent is the sum of these two: 2x + 12x = 14x.
4. We also know that she had 56 amount of change remaining. This means that she spent some amount of money and got back 56. Let's call the amount she spent ""y"". Therefore, she spent y and got back y + 56.
5. We can set up an equation using the information we have: y + 56 = 14x.
6. We need to find out how many packs of groceries she bought in all, which is the sum of cookies and cakes. That is 2 + 12 = 14.
7. We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 14: (y + 56)/14 = x.
8. Now we know the price of each pack, which is (y + 56)/14.
9. To find out how many packs of groceries she bought in all, we can divide the amount she spent by the price of each pack: y/[(y + 56)/14] = 14y/(y + 56).
10. We don't know the exact value of y, but we know that the result must be a whole number. Let's try some values of y and see if we get a whole number:
- If y = 56, then 14y/(y + 56) = 14, which means she bought 14 packs of groceries in all. This seems like a valid solution.
- If y = 112, then 14y/(y + 56) = 28, which means she bought 28 packs of groceries in all. This doesn't seem right, because she only bought 14 packs of cookies and cakes.

2. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so let's say she gave x baseball cards and y Ace cards.
3. After giving some cards to Jeff, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left. So we can write two equations:
   - 246 - x = 404 (the number of baseball cards she had minus the number she gave to Jeff equals the number she has left)
   - 214 - y = 495 (the number of Ace cards she had minus the number she gave to Jeff equals the number she has left)
4. Solving these equations, we get:
   - x = 158 (Nell gave 158 baseball cards to Jeff)
   - y = 281 (Nell gave 281 Ace cards to Jeff)
5. Now we can calculate how many more Ace cards than baseball cards Nell has:

After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add up the weight Jessie lost in the first and second week: 

62 kg + 140 kg = 202 kg 

Next, we need to subtract this amount from her current weight: 

9 kg - 202 kg = -193 kg 

Uh oh, this doesn't make sense! A negative weight is not possible. 

Therefore, we can conclude that there must be an error in the problem statement. Perhaps Jessie lost 6.2 kg and 14 kg instead of 62 kg and 140 kg?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. First, we need to find out how many students can fit on one bus. Since there are 3 seats on each bus, we can divide the total number of students by 3: 

111 students ÷ 3 seats per bus = 37 buses 

2. However, we also need to consider how many classrooms there are in the school. If we assume that each classroom has an equal number of students, we can divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms: 

111 students ÷ 72 classrooms = 1.54 students per classroom 

This means that there may be some classrooms with only 1 or 2 students, which would not require a full bus. 

3. To be safe, we can round up to the nearest whole number of buses needed: 

37 buses rounded up = 38 buses 

Therefore, we would need 38 buses to transport all 111 students on the field trip. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",38

There were 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the day Rachel visited. We also know that there were 188 visitors the previous day. So in total, there were:

557 + 188 = 745 visitors in two days

Now, we need to figure out how many visitors came in 57 days. We can use proportions to solve this problem. If 745 visitors came in two days, then how many visitors would come in 57 days?

745 visitors / 2 days = x visitors / 57 days

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

745 * 57 = 2 * x

42,465 = 2x

x = 21,232.5

So approximately 21,233 visitors would come to the Buckingham palace in 57 days. However, since we can't have half a visitor, we should round this number to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we can say that about 21,233 visitors would come to the Buckingham palace in 57 days. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","21,233.00"

Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 28 children were initially on the bus. Then, 82 children got on the bus, so we add those two numbers: 28 + 82 = 110 children.

However, we also know that some children got off the bus, and there were 30 children left on the bus. So, we can write an equation: 110 - x = 30, where x is the number of children who got off the bus.

Now, we can solve for x: 110 - x = 30 => x = 110 - 30 => x = 80 children got off the bus.

Finally, we need to find how many more children got on the bus than those that got off. We already know that 82 children got on the bus, so we subtract the number of children who got off the bus: 82 - 80 = 2.

So, 2 more children got on the bus than those that got off. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2

A: Let's think step by step. Tiffany had 7 bags of cans on Monday.
On the next day, she found 12 more bags worth of cans.

To find out how many more bags she found on the next day than she had on Monday, we can subtract the number of bags she had on Monday from the number of bags she found on the next day:

12 bags - 7 bags = <<12-7=5>>5 bags

So, Tiffany found 5 more bags of cans on the next day than she had on Monday. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5

If there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets How many baskets of peaches are there?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, which means each basket has a total of 4 + 3 = 7 peaches. 

Now, we are given that there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets. Since each basket has 7 peaches, there must be only 1 basket of peaches. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1

There, Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 246 visitors on that day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of visitors in those two days. We know that there were 703 visitors on the previous day and 246 visitors on that day. So, we can add these two numbers to find the total number of visitors in those two days:

703 (previous day) + 246 (that day) = 949 visitors (in two days)

Now, we need to find the average number of visitors per day. To do this, we can divide the total number of visitors in those two days by 2:

949 visitors (in two days) / 2 = 474.5 visitors per day (on average)

Finally, we need to find the total number of visitors within 25 days. To do this, we can multiply the average number of visitors per day by 25:

474.5 visitors per day (on average) * 25 days = 11,862.5 visitors

Since we cannot have a fraction of a visitor, we can round this number to the nearest whole number:

11,862.5 visitors ≈ 11,863 visitors

So, approximately 11,863 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 25 days. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",11863

If she spent 4 dollars. How much more money did she receive from her mom than she did from her dad?

A: Let's think step by step. First, Gwen received 5 dollars from her dad. Then, her mom gave her 7 more dollars. So, she had a total of 5 + 7 = <<5+7=12>>12 dollars.

After that, she spent 4 dollars. So, she had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 dollars left.

Now, we want to find out how much more money she received from her mom than from her dad. Since her mom gave her 7 dollars and her dad gave her 5 dollars, the difference is 7 - 5 = <<7-5=2>>2 dollars.

So, Gwen received 2 dollars more from her mom than from her dad. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2

If you read 19 of the movies and watched 16 of the books How many more movies than books have you read?

A: Let's think step by step. First, there are 8 books and 5 movies in the series. You mentioned that you read 19 of the movies and watched 16 of the books, but this seems to be a mix-up. Let's assume you meant that you read 19 books and watched 16 movies.

Now, since there are only 8 books and 5 movies in the series, you could not have read more than 8 books or watched more than 5 movies. So, let's correct the numbers to 8 books read and 5 movies watched.

Finally, to find out how many more movies than books you have read, we can subtract the number of books you read from the number of movies you watched:

5 movies - 8 books = -3

So, you have read 3 more books than movies. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",-3

Now he has 21 bottle caps and 52 wrappers in his collection. How many more bottle caps than wrappers did danny find at the park?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps and wrappers Danny had before he found the ones at the park. To do this, we can subtract the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park from the total number he has now.

For bottle caps:
Total number of bottle caps now = 21
Number of bottle caps found at the park = 50
So, the number of bottle caps he had before = 21 - 50 = -29

For wrappers:
Total number of wrappers now = 52
Number of wrappers found at the park = 46
So, the number of wrappers he had before = 52 - 46 = 6

Now, we can find the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park.

Difference = Number of bottle caps found at the park - Number of wrappers found at the park
Difference = 50 - 46 = 4

So, Danny found 4 more bottle caps than wrappers at the park. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4

How many more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many push-ups David did. We know he did 58 more than Zachary, who did 35. So, David did 35 + 58 = <<35+58=93>>93 push-ups.

Now, we need to find out how many crunches David did. We know he did 87 less than Zachary, who did 3. So, David did 3 - 87 = -84 crunches. However, since it's not possible to do a negative number of crunches, there might be an error in the problem statement. 

Regardless, we can still find out how many more push-ups than crunches Zachary did. He did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches, so he did 35 - 3 = <<35-3=32>>32 more push-ups than crunches. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",32

She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many cards Nell had in total before giving some to Jeff. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards, so she had 309 + 356 = <<309+356=665>>665 cards.

Now, we know that she has 415 cards left after giving some to Jeff. So, she gave away 665 - 415 = <<665-415=250>>250 cards to Jeff.

Let's denote the number of baseball cards Nell has left as B and the number of Ace cards she has left as A. We know that B + A = 415.

We also know that Nell initially had 309 baseball cards, so she gave away 309 - B baseball cards to Jeff. Similarly, she initially had 356 Ace cards, so she gave away 356 - A Ace cards to Jeff.

Since the total number of cards given to Jeff is 250, we can write the equation (309 - B) + (356 - A) = 250.

Now, we have two equations with two variables:

1) B + A = 415
2) (309 - B) + (356 - A) = 250

Let's solve these equations simultaneously. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","From equation 1, we can write A = 415 - B. Now, let's substitute this expression for A in equation 2:

(309 - B) + (356 - (415 - B)) = 250

Now, let's simplify and solve for B:

309 - B + 356 - 415 + B = 250
B - B = 250 - 309 - 356 + 415
0 = -250
B = 309

Now that we have the value of B, let's find the value of A:

A = 415 - B
A = 415 - 309
A = 106

Now we can find the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has:

Difference = B - A
Difference = 309 - 106
Difference = 203

Nell has 203 more baseball cards than Ace cards."

gpt-4-0314,Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar How many cups of flour did she put in?,2.0,sbs,"Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar How many cups of flour did she put in?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Mary still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar. Let's represent the number of cups of sugar she still needs as x. Then the number of cups of flour she still needs is x + 2.

Now, we know that the recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar. So, the total amount of flour and sugar she still needs to put in is:

x + 2 (flour) + x (sugar) = 11 (flour) + 7 (sugar)

Combining the x terms, we get:

2x + 2 = 18

Now, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 16

Finally, we can divide both sides by 2 to find the value of x:

x = 8

So, Mary still needs to put in 8 cups of sugar. Since she needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, she still needs 10 cups of flour. Since the recipe calls for 11 cups of flour, she has already put in:

11 (total cups of flour) - 10 (cups of flour still needed) = 1 cup of flour. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1

The frog jumped 18 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 2 inches farther than the frog. How far did the mouse jump?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches. 

Next, we need to figure out how far the frog jumped. We know that the frog jumped 18 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can add 18 to 25: 

25 + 18 = 43 

So the frog jumped 43 inches. 

Finally, we need to figure out how far the mouse jumped. We know that the mouse jumped 2 inches farther than the frog, so we can add 2 to 43:

He needs a total of 49 g of colors to paint them. If the feathers require 288 g of wax and right now he just needs 260 g How many grams of wax does he already have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that he needs a total of 49 g of colors to paint the feathers. This information is not relevant to finding out how many grams of wax he already has, but we'll keep it in mind for later.

Next, we know that the feathers require 288 g of wax. However, he only needs 260 g right now. This means that he already has some wax, but we don't know how much.

To find out how much wax he already has, we can subtract the amount he needs from the total amount required:

288 g - 260 g = 28 g

Therefore, he already has 28 g of wax. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",28

She already put in 5 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar.
2. Mary already put in 5 cups of flour.
3. So, she still needs to add 14 - 5 = 9 cups of flour.

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Steven has 8 peaches and 12 apples.
2. Jake has 13 more apples than Steven, so he has 12 + 13 = 25 apples.
3. Jake has 17 fewer peaches than Steven, so he has 8 - 17 = -9 peaches.
4. Wait a minute, how can Jake have negative peaches? That doesn't make sense.
5. We made a mistake in step 3. Jake cannot have negative peaches, so we need to adjust our calculation.
6. Instead of saying Jake has 17 fewer peaches than Steven, we can say he has 17 more apples than peaches.
7. So, Jake has 25 apples and 8 peaches - 17 = -9 apples + 17 = 8 peaches.
8. Now our calculation makes sense. Jake has 25 apples and 8 peaches. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",25 apples.

How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill, and Steven has 4 peaches. So, Jill must have 4 - 11 = -7 peaches. This doesn't make sense, so we need to check our initial information.

2. We know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. Since Steven has 4 peaches, Jake must have 4 - 12 = -8 peaches. Again, this doesn't make sense.

3. We need to adjust our initial information. Let's assume that Steven actually has 15 peaches (instead of 4). Then, Jill would have 15 - 11 = 4 peaches, and Jake would have 15 - 12 = 3 peaches.

4. Now we can answer the question. Jill has 4 peaches and Jake has 3 peaches, so Jill has 4 - 3 = 1 more peach than Jake. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1

gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages. It took frank 664 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?,332.0,sbs,"Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages. It took frank 664 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of pages in the book. Since there are 2 chapters and each chapter has 405 pages, the total number of pages is:

2 x 405 = 810 pages

Next, we need to find how many pages Frank read per day. To do this, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days it took him to finish the book:

810 pages ÷ 664 days = 1.22 pages per day

However, the question asks how many chapters Frank read per day, not how many pages. Since we know that each chapter has 405 pages, we can divide the pages per day by the number of pages in a chapter:

1.22 pages per day ÷ 405 pages per chapter = 0.003 chapters per day

So, Frank read approximately 0.003 chapters per day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",0.003 chapters per day.

There are now 23 roses in the vase. How many roses did she cut?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with the initial number of roses in the vase, which is 2.
Step 2: Jessica threw away 4 roses, so we need to subtract 4 from the initial number: 2 - 4 = -2.
Step 3: The result is negative, which means we need to add some roses to get to the final number of 23. Let's call the number of roses Jessica cut ""x"". So we have: -2 + x = 23.
Step 4: To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 2 to both sides: -2 + x + 2 = 23 + 2, which simplifies to x = 25.
Step 5: Jessica cut 25 roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",25
gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,"Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework, 10 pages of reading homework and 6 more pages of biology homework. How many pages of reading and biology homework did she have to complete?",16.0,sbs,"Q: Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework, 10 pages of reading homework and 6 more pages of biology homework. How many pages of reading and biology homework did she have to complete?

A: Let's think step by step. Rachel had to complete:
- 5 pages of math homework
- 10 pages of reading homework
- 6 more pages of biology homework

So, the total number of pages of biology homework is 6 more than some unknown number of pages of reading homework. Let's call the number of pages of reading homework ""x"". 

Therefore, the total number of pages of biology homework is x + 6. 

And we know that Rachel had to complete a total of 5 + 10 + (x + 6) pages of homework. 

Simplifying this expression, we get: 

5 + 10 + x + 6 = 21 + x 

So, Rachel had to complete 21 + x pages of homework in total. 

To answer the question, we just need to find the value of x. 

We know that Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework, so the total number of pages of homework she had to complete (21 + x) must be at least 5. 

Therefore: 

21 + x ≥ 5 

Subtracting 21 from both sides: 

x ≥ -16 

This means that Rachel had to complete at least -16 pages of reading homework, which doesn't make sense. So, we made a mistake somewhere. 

Let's go back to the problem and check if we missed any information. 

Ah, we did miss something! The problem says that Rachel had to complete a total of 21 pages of homework, not 21 + x pages. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

5 + 10 + (x + 6) = 21 

Simplifying: 

x + 21 = 21 

Subtracting 21 from both sides: 

x = 0 

So, Rachel had to complete 0 pages of reading homework and 6 pages of biology homework. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",0 pages of reading homework and 6 pages of biology homework.

7. We know that Steven has 16 peaches, so we can substitute S = 16 into the equation: 16 - 9 = J + 18.
8. Simplifying the equation, we get: J = 7.
9. So Jake has 7 peaches and Jill has 7 - 18 = -11 peaches. This still doesn't make sense, so we made another mistake.
10. Let's try one more time. We know that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can write an equation: J = S - 9, where J is the number of peaches Jake has and S is the number of peaches Steven has.
11. We also know that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, so we can write another equation: J = J + 18, where J is the number of peaches Jill has.
12. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get: S - 9 = J + 18.
13. We know that Steven has 16 peaches, so we can substitute S = 16 into the equation: 16 - 9 = J + 18.
14. Simplifying the equation, we get: J = 7.
15. So Jake has 7 peaches and Jill has J - 18 = -11 peaches.
16. Finally, we can answer the question: Steven has 16 - (-11) Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",27 peaches more than Jill.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pages Frank read in total. To do that, we can multiply the number of pages in each book (249) by the number of books he read. We don't know how many books he read, but we can call that number ""x"". So:

Total number of pages = 249x

Next, we need to find out how many days it took Frank to read all those pages. We know that it took him 3 days to read each book, so if he read ""x"" books, it would take him:

Total number of days = 3x

Finally, we can divide the total number of pages by the total number of days to find out how many pages he read per day:

Pages per day = (Total number of pages) / (Total number of days)

If the erasers are organized into 495 groups How big is each group?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many erasers are in each group. We can do this by dividing the total number of erasers by the number of groups:

4950 ÷ 495 = 10

So each group has 10 erasers.

Next, we need to figure out what this has to do with the number of skittles in Steven's collection. It's possible that there's no connection at all, but let's assume that there is.

One way to approach this is to ask: how many skittles would Steven need to have in order for the number of skittles to be the same as the number of erasers in one group?

To answer this, we can divide the total number of skittles by the number of groups:

3941 ÷ 495 = 7.96

So Steven would need to have about 8 skittles in order for the number of skittles to be the same as the number of erasers in one group.

Of course, this is just an approximation, since you can't have a fraction of a skittle. But it gives us an idea of the relative sizes of the two collections. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10 erasers per group.

How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?,5590.0,sbs,"Q: The Razorback t-shirt shop sells each t-shirt for $ 51 dollars. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they offered a discount of $ 8 per t-shirt and sold 130 t-shirts. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the discounted price of each t-shirt:

Discounted price = Original price - Discount
Discounted price = $51 - $8
Discounted price = $43

Now, we know that they sold 130 t-shirts, so we can calculate the total revenue:

Total revenue = Number of t-shirts sold x Discounted price
Total revenue = 130 x $43

Total hours = 6 hours (English) + 7 hours (Chinese) = 13 hours

Next, we need to find the difference between the number of hours Ryan spends on learning Chinese and English:

Difference = 7 hours (Chinese) - 6 hours (English) = 1 hour

Therefore, Ryan spends 1 more hour on learning Chinese than he does on learning English. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1

gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,41 campers went rowing and 4 campers went hiking in the morning. 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon. How many campers went rowing and hiking in all?,71.0,sbs,"Q: 41 campers went rowing and 4 campers went hiking in the morning. 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon. How many campers went rowing and hiking in all?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 41 campers went rowing in the morning and 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon. So in total, 41 + 26 = 67 campers went rowing.

Next, we know that 4 campers went hiking in the morning. We don't know how many campers went hiking in the afternoon, but we do know that the question is asking for the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all.

So we need to add the number of campers who went rowing and hiking in the morning to the number of campers who went rowing and hiking in the afternoon. We know that 4 campers went hiking in the morning, but we don't know how many of those 41 campers who went rowing in the morning also went hiking.

Let's call the number of campers who went rowing and hiking in the morning ""x"". Then we can set up an equation:

x + 4 = the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all

We know that the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all is 67 (the number who went rowing) plus some unknown number ""x"" who also went hiking. So we can rewrite the equation as:

x + 4 = 67 + x

Now we can solve for ""x"":

x - x = 67 - 4
0 = 63

Uh oh, something went wrong! We ended up with an equation that doesn't make sense. What happened?

Well, let's think about what the equation is saying. It's saying that the number of campers who went rowing and hiking in the morning plus 4 (the number who went hiking in the morning) is equal to the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all. But that doesn't make sense, because some of the campers who went rowing in the morning might not have gone hiking at all, and some of the campers who went rowing in the afternoon might have gone hiking instead.

So we need to approach the problem differently. One way to do this is to use a Venn diagram. We can draw two circles, one for rowing and one for hiking, and label the parts that we know:

```
         Rowing
        /      \
Morning        Afternoon
  41              26
        \ Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","We can see from the Venn diagram that there is no overlap between the morning hiking group and the afternoon rowing group. So the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all is:

41 (morning rowing and hiking) + 0 (no overlap with afternoon rowing) + 0 (no overlap with morning hiking) + 0 (no overlap with afternoon hiking) = 41

Therefore, 41 campers went rowing and hiking in all."

Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 17 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she cut than those she threw away?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Jessica started with 15 roses in the vase.
Step 2: She threw away 33 roses, so now there are 15 - 33 = -18 roses in the vase. This doesn't make sense, so we know we made a mistake.
Step 3: We need to add the new roses that Jessica cut from her garden. Let's call this number ""x"". So now we have: 15 - 33 + x = 17.
Step 4: We can simplify this equation by adding 33 to both sides: 15 + x = 50.
Step 5: Now we can solve for x by subtracting 15 from both sides: x = 35.
Step 6: Finally, we can answer the question by finding the difference between the number of roses Jessica cut and the number she threw away: 35 - 33 = 2. 

Therefore, Jessica cut 2 more roses than she threw away. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2

He found out that they harvest 65 sacks of unripe oranges and 46 sacks of ripe oranges per day. How many sacks of unripe oranges will they have after 6 days of harvest?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many sacks of unripe oranges they harvest in 6 days. To do this, we can multiply the daily harvest by the number of days:

65 sacks/day x 6 days = 390 sacks

So, they will harvest 390 sacks of unripe oranges in 6 days.

Next, we need to subtract the number of ripe oranges they harvest each day from the total number of oranges harvested each day to find out how many unripe oranges they harvest each day:

Total oranges harvested per day = 65 sacks of unripe oranges + 46 sacks of ripe oranges = 111 sacks

Unripe oranges harvested per day = Total oranges harvested per day - Ripe oranges harvested per day = 111 sacks - 46 sacks = 65 sacks

Therefore, they harvest 65 sacks of unripe oranges each day.

Finally, we can multiply the daily harvest of unripe oranges by the number of days to find out how many sacks of unripe oranges they will have after 6 days:

65 sacks/day x 6 days = 390 sacks

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug. Let's represent the number of marbles Doug has as D and the number of marbles Ed has as E. So, E = D + 29.

Next, Ed lost 17 marbles at the playground. So, his new total is E - 17.

Now, we want to find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug after losing 17 marbles. To do this, we can subtract Doug's marbles (D) from Ed's new total (E - 17).

So, the difference is (E - 17) - D.

The next day she found 4 more bags worth of cans. If she had a total of 8 bags altogether How many bags did she have on monday?

A: Let's think step by step. Tiffany had some bags of cans on Monday. Let's call the number of bags she had on Monday ""M"".

On Tuesday, she found 4 more bags worth of cans. So, we can say that on Tuesday, she had M + 4 bags.

We know that she had a total of 8 bags altogether. So, M + 4 = 8.

Now, we just need to solve for M. To do this, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

M + 4 - 4 = 8 - 4
M = 4

So, Tiffany had 4 bags of cans on Monday. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4

Now he has 42 bottle caps in his collection. How many more bottle caps did danny throw away than those he found at the park?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found the new ones and threw away the old ones. Since he now has 42 bottle caps, and he found 30 new ones, he must have had 42 - 30 = 12 bottle caps before.

Now, we know that he threw away 63 old bottle caps. Since he had 12 bottle caps before, he must have had 63 - 12 = 51 bottle caps before he found the new ones.

Finally, we need to find out how many more bottle caps he threw away than those he found at the park. To do this, we subtract the number of bottle caps he found at the park from the number of bottle caps he threw away: 63 - 30 = 33.

So, Danny threw away 33 more bottle caps than those he found at the park. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",33

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many games Kelly needs to have in total to have 140 games left. To do this, we can use the equation:

Total games = Current games + Games to buy

We know that Kelly currently has 22 games, so we can plug that into the equation:

Total games = 22 + Games to buy

Now, we need to find out how many games Kelly needs to buy so that she will have 140 games left. To do this, we can use the equation:

Games left = Total games - Games to buy

We know that Kelly wants to have 140 games left, so we can plug that into the equation:

140 = Total games - Games to buy

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for the number of games Kelly needs to buy:

140 = (22 + Games to buy) - Games to buy

Now, we can solve for the number of games Kelly needs to buy:

140 = 22 + Games to buy - Games to buy

140 = 22

Games to buy = 140 - 22

Games to buy = 118

So, Kelly needs to buy 118 more games to have 140 games left. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",118

She already put in 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour does she need to add?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cups of flour Mary needs to add to match the amount of sugar she already put in. Since she put in 60 cups of sugar, and the recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar, we can find out how many times she multiplied the sugar by dividing 60 by 6. 

60 ÷ 6 = 10

So, Mary put in 10 times the amount of sugar the recipe calls for. Now, we need to find out how many cups of flour she needs to match this amount. Since the recipe calls for 14 cups of flour, we can multiply this by 10:

14 × 10 = 140

Now we know that Mary needs 140 cups of flour in total. Since she already put in 7 cups of flour, we can subtract this from the total amount she needs:

140 - 7 = 133

So, Mary needs to add 133 more cups of flour. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",133

There are now 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. How many more orchids than roses are there in the vase now?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many roses and orchids Jessica cut from her garden. We know that there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase before she cut more flowers. Now there are 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. 

To find out how many roses she cut, we can subtract the initial number of roses from the final number of roses: 

11 roses (final) - 7 roses (initial) = 4 roses 

So, Jessica cut 4 roses from her garden. 

Now let's do the same for the orchids: 

20 orchids (final) - 12 orchids (initial) = 8 orchids 

So, Jessica cut 8 orchids from her garden. 

Now we want to find out how many more orchids than roses are in the vase. We know there are 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase now. 

To find the difference between the number of orchids and roses, we can subtract the number of roses from the number of orchids:

If she drank 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a day How many days would the soda bottles last?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many soda bottles Debby has left after drinking 9 soda bottles a day. To do this, we can use the formula:

Total soda bottles - (Number of soda bottles drunk per day * Number of days) = Remaining soda bottles

We know the total number of soda bottles is 360, and Debby drinks 9 soda bottles a day. We want to find out how many days the soda bottles would last, so we can represent the number of days with the variable ""x"". Now we can set up the equation:

360 - (9 * x) = Remaining soda bottles

Now we need to solve for x. Since Debby drinks all the soda bottles, the remaining soda bottles will be 0. So we can set up the equation:

360 - (9 * x) = 0

Now we can solve for x:

9 * x = 360

x = 360 / 9

x = 40

So the soda bottles would last for 40 days. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",40

gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?",57.0,sbs,"Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We need to find the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days. 

To do this, we can add up the number of visitors from the previous two days and multiply by 245: 

Total visitors in previous 245 days = (191 + 457) x 245 = 164,420 

2. Now we need to find the difference between the total visitors in the previous 245 days and the number of visitors on the current day: 

Difference = 705 - 164,420 = -163,715 

Wait a minute, a negative number? That doesn't make sense. 

It seems like there might be an error in the question. Perhaps it was meant to ask how many more visitors came on that day compared to the average number of visitors in the previous 245 days? 

If we assume that's the case, we can calculate the average number of visitors per day in the previous 245 days: 

Average visitors per day = Total visitors / Number of days = 164,420 / 245 = 670.94 (rounded to two decimal places) 

Now we can find the difference between the number of visitors on the current day and the average number of visitors per day in the previous 245 days: 

Difference = 705 - 670.94 = 34.06 (rounded to two decimal places) 

So the answer is that 34 more visitors came to the Buckingham palace on that day compared to the average number of visitors in the previous 245 days. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",34

How many books did he sell in the garage sale?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Start with the initial number of books and pens: Paul had 108 books and 55 pens.
2. Then, we know that he sold some books and pens in a garage sale, so we need to subtract the final number of books and pens from the initial number: 

- Final number of books: 66
- Final number of pens: 59

- Difference in books: 108 - 66 = 42
- Difference in pens: 55 - 59 = -4

3. We can see that Paul actually ended up with more pens than he started with, which means he must have bought or received some additional pens. Therefore, we can ignore the negative difference in pens and focus on the difference in books: 

- Difference in books: 42

Therefore, Paul sold 42 books in the garage sale. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",42

If David did 38 push-ups How many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary.
2. We also know that David did 38 push-ups.
3. So, we can use subtraction to find out how many push-ups Zachary did: 

   Zachary's push-ups = David's push-ups - 56
                      = 38 - 56
                      = -18

   Uh oh, this doesn't make sense! We can't have negative push-ups. This means there must be an error in the problem. 

   Perhaps the problem meant to say that Zachary did 56 fewer push-ups than David. In that case, we would use addition instead of subtraction: 

   Zachary's push-ups = David's push-ups - 56
                      = 38 - 56
                      = -18

   Zachary's push-ups = David's push-ups + 56
                      = 38 + 56
                      = 94

   Now we have a reasonable answer! 

4. To find the total number of push-ups, we simply add David's and Zachary's push-ups: 

   Total push-ups = David's push-ups + Zachary's push-ups
                  = 38 + 94
                  = 132

   So, David and Zachary did 132 push-ups altogether. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",132

2. Danny found 58 new bottle caps, so he now has a total of 7 + 58 = 65 bottle caps that are not old ones he threw away.
3. We know that the total number of bottle caps Danny had at first is the sum of the old ones he threw away and the new ones he found, so we can set up an equation: 

x (total number of bottle caps at first) = 60 (old ones thrown away) + 58 (new ones found) + 7 (remaining non-old ones)

4. Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 125

Therefore, Danny had 125 bottle caps at first. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",125

gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,Steven has 19 peaches. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven and 72 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jake have?,7.0,sbs,"Q: Steven has 19 peaches. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven and 72 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jake have?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Steven has 19 peaches.
2. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, which means Jake has 19 - 12 = 7 peaches.
3. Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill, but we don't know how many peaches Jill has.
4. Let's use algebra to solve for Jill's number of peaches. We can write an equation: Jake's peaches = Jill's peaches + 72. We know Jake has 7 peaches, so we can substitute that in: 7 = Jill's peaches + 72.
5. Solving for Jill's peaches, we subtract 72 from both sides: Jill's peaches = -65.
6. Wait a minute, a negative number of peaches doesn't make sense! We made a mistake somewhere.
7. Let's go back to step 2. We assumed that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, but that might not be the case. It's possible that Jake has 12 more peaches than Steven, which would make more sense.
8. So let's try that: Jake has 12 more peaches than Steven, which means Jake has 19 + 12 = 31 peaches.
9. Now we can use the same equation as before to solve for Jill's peaches: Jake's peaches = Jill's peaches + 72. We know Jake has 31 peaches, so we can substitute that in: 31 = Jill's peaches + 72.
10. Solving for Jill's peaches, we subtract 72 from both sides: Jill's peaches = -41.
11. Oops, we still got a negative number of peaches! We made another mistake somewhere.
12. Let's go back to step 8. We assumed that Jake has 12 more peaches than Steven, but that might not be the case either. It's possible that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, which would make even more sense.
13. So let's try that: Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, which means Jake has 19 - 12 = 7 peaches.
14. Now we can use the same equation as before to solve for Jill's peaches: Jake's peaches = Jill's peaches + 72. We know Jake has 7 peaches, so we can substitute that in: 7 = Jill Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",31

How many animals does he have in total?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of animals in the saltwater aquariums. 

15 aquariums x 19 animals per aquarium = 285 animals in saltwater aquariums 

Next, we need to find the total number of animals in the freshwater aquariums. 

62 aquariums x 19 animals per aquarium = 1178 animals in freshwater aquariums 

Finally, we can add the two totals together to find the total number of animals. 

285 animals in saltwater aquariums + 1178 animals in freshwater aquariums = 1463 animals in total

gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 101 kilograms. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?,128.0,sbs,"Q: Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 101 kilograms. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?

A: Let's think step by step. Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms. 

After jogging everyday, she lost 101 kilograms. 

This means her current weight is 27 - 101 = -74 kilograms. 

However, this doesn't make sense because a person's weight cannot be negative. 

Therefore, we can assume that there is an error in the question. 

Perhaps Jessie lost 10.1 kilograms instead of 101 kilograms. 

In that case, her current weight would be 27 - 10.1 = 16.9 kilograms. 

To find out how much she weighed before starting to jog, we need to add the 10.1 kilograms she lost to her current weight. 

So, Jessie's weight before starting to jog was 27 + 10.1 = 37.1 kilograms. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",37.1 kilograms.

If there are 510 more boys than girls How many boys are there in that school?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of students in the school.
Total number of students = number of girls + number of boys
Total number of students = 635 + (the rest)

Step 2: Use the information given to find the number of boys.
We know that there are 510 more boys than girls. So:
Number of boys = Number of girls + 510

Step 3: Substitute the expression for ""the rest"" from Step 1 into the equation from Step 2.
Number of boys = Number of girls + 510
Number of boys = (Total number of students - 635) + 510

Step 4: Simplify the equation.
Number of boys = Total number of students - 125

Step 5: Substitute the value of the total number of students from Step 1 into the equation from Step 4.
Number of boys = Total number of students - 125
Number of boys = (635 + the rest) - 125

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pairs of bananas we can make from the collection of 18 bananas. To do this, we can use the formula for combinations:

nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!

where n is the total number of items (in this case, 18) and r is the number of items we want to choose for each group (in this case, 2).

So, plugging in the numbers:

18C2 = 18! / 2!(18-2)! = 18! / 2!16! = (18x17) / 2 = 153

This means there are 153 pairs of bananas we can make from the collection of 18 bananas.

Next, we need to find out how many groups of size 2 we can make from these pairs. Since each group consists of 2 bananas, we can simply divide the total number of pairs by 2:

153 / 2 = 76.5

2. He got a box of crayons for his birthday.
3. By the end of the school year, he had 291 crayons left.
4. He either lost or gave away 315 crayons.
5. We need to find out how many crayons he got for his birthday.

To solve this problem, we can use subtraction. We know that Paul had some crayons before his birthday, and then he got a box of crayons for his birthday. So, the total number of crayons he had at the beginning of the school year is:

Total number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday

We don't know how many crayons Paul had before his birthday, but we can use the information we have to find out. We know that he lost or gave away 315 crayons, so we can write:

Total number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315

We also know that by the end of the school year, Paul had 291 crayons left. So we can write:

291 = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315

Now we can solve for Crayons from birthday:

Crayons from birthday = 291 + 315 - Crayons before birthday

We don't know Crayons before birthday, but we know that it must be less than or equal to 291 (since Paul had 291 crayons left at the end of the school year). So we can try different values of Crayons before birthday until we find one that works. Let's start with Crayons before birthday = 0:

Crayons from birthday = 291 + 315 - 0 = 606

This means that Paul got 606 crayons for his birthday! Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",606

The program could seat 44 people How many people were present in the program?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add the number of parents and pupils to find out how many people were supposed to attend the program:

61 parents + 177 pupils = 238 people

However, we know that the program could only seat 44 people. This means that only 44 people could physically be present at the program at any given time.

So, we need to figure out how many people actually attended the program. We know that the maximum number of people who could attend was 44, so we need to find the minimum number of times that 44 can go into 238.

238 ÷ 44 = 5 with a remainder of 18

This means that 5 groups of 44 people could attend the program, with 18 people left over. However, since we know that the program could only seat 44 people at a time, we need to round up to the next whole number.

5 groups + 1 extra group = 6 groups

So, there were 6 groups of people who attended the program, with 44 people in each group, and 18 people left over. To find out how many people were present in the program, we need to add up the number of people in each group, plus the 18 extra people:

6 groups x 44 people per group = 264 people

264 people + 18 extra people = 282 people

Therefore, there were 282 people present in the program. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",282

If she spent 6 dollars. How much more money did she receive from her dad than she did from her mom?

A: Let's think step by step. Gwen received 5 dollars from her dad. 

Her mom gave her 2 more dollars. 

So, in total, she received 5 + 2 = 7 dollars. 

If she spent 6 dollars, she has 7 - 6 = 1 dollar left. 

Now, to answer the question, we need to find the difference between what she received from her dad and what she received from her mom. 

The difference is 5 - 2 = 3 dollars. 

Therefore, Gwen received 3 dollars more from her dad than she did from her mom. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Steven has 9 peaches and 8 apples. 

Next, we know that Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven. So, Jake has 9 - 13 = -4 peaches. Wait a minute, how can Jake have negative peaches? That doesn't make sense. 

Let's double check the problem. It says that Jake has 13 fewer peaches and 3 more apples than Steven. But if we use the information we have so far, it doesn't seem to add up. 

So, let's assume that there was a mistake in the problem and that Jake actually has 13 more peaches than Steven. In that case, Jake would have 9 + 13 = 22 peaches.

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Dan has $2.
2. Each candy bar costs $3.
3. Dan bought some candy bars for a total of $6 each.
4. We can use algebra to solve for the number of candy bars Dan bought. Let's call the number of candy bars x.
5. The total cost of the candy bars is 6x (since he bought some candy bars for a total of $6 each).
6. We know that Dan had $2 to start with, so we can set up an equation: 

2 + 6x = 3x 

7. Now we can solve for x: 

2 + 6x = 3x 

2 = -3x 

x = -2/3 

8. This doesn't make sense - you can't buy a negative number of candy bars! So we know there's an error somewhere. 

9. Let's go back to step 6. We made a mistake - the equation should be: 

2 + 6x = total cost of candy bars 

10. Now we can set up the correct equation: 

2 + 6x = total cost of candy bars 

11. We know that each candy bar costs $3, so we can write: 

total cost of candy bars = 3x 

12. Now we can substitute this into our equation: 

2 + 6x = 3x 

13. Simplifying: 

2 + 3x = 0 

3x = -2 

x = -2/3 

14. This still doesn't make sense - you can't buy a negative number of candy bars! 

15. We made another mistake - we assumed that Dan bought some candy bars for a total of $6 each. But we don't know how many candy bars he bought at that price. 

16. Let's call the number of candy bars he bought at $6 each y. 

17. We know that each candy bar he bought at $6 each costs $6, so we can write: 

total cost of candy bars bought at $6 each = 6y 

18. We also know that each candy bar he bought at $3 each costs $3, so we can write: 

total cost of candy bars bought at $3 each = 3(x-y) 

19. Now we can set up an equation for the total cost of all the candy bars:

If they are travelling at speed of 17 How much farther until they reach the end of the cave?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much deeper the cave is from their current position:

1218 feet (total depth) - 849 feet (current position) = 369 feet

So they still need to descend 369 feet to reach the end of the cave.

Next, we need to figure out how long it will take them to descend that distance at a speed of 17 feet per unit of time. We can use the formula:

distance = speed x time

To solve for time, we can rearrange the formula:

time = distance / speed

Plugging in the values we know:

time = 369 feet / 17 feet per unit of time

time ≈ 21.7 units of time

So it will take them approximately 21.7 units of time to descend the remaining distance.

Note: We don't know what the units of time are (seconds, minutes, hours, etc.) so we can't give an exact time in real-world units. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",369 / 17 ≈ 21.7.

There, Rachel learned that 92 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace before that day?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that there were 92 visitors on the day Rachel went to see the Buckingham palace.
2. We also know that there were 419 visitors the previous day.
3. And we know that there were 103 visitors the day before that.
4. We want to find out how many visitors there were before that day.

To solve this problem, we need to add up the number of visitors from the three days we know and subtract that from the total number of visitors up to that day.

Total visitors up to the day Rachel went = visitors on Rachel's day + visitors the previous day + visitors the day before that + visitors before that day

We know the first three terms:

Total visitors up to the day Rachel went = 92 + 419 + 103 + visitors before that day

We can simplify this equation:

Total visitors up to the day Rachel went = 614 + visitors before that day

We also know that the total number of visitors up to that day includes the visitors on the day Rachel went:

Total visitors up to the day Rachel went = visitors on Rachel's day + visitors before that day

We can substitute this into the previous equation:

visitors on Rachel's day + visitors before that day = 614 + visitors before that day

We can simplify this equation:

visitors on Rachel's day = 614

Therefore, there were 614 visitors before the day Rachel went to see the Buckingham palace. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",614

3. To do that, we need to divide the total number of students (92) by the number of buses (46). 

92 ÷ 46 = 2 

4. This means that each bus needs to have 2 students per seat. 
5. However, we don't know how many seats are in each bus. 
6. To find out, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats in each bus. 

92 ÷ (46 x S) = 2 

Solving for S: 

92 ÷ (46 x S) = 2 

92 = 92S 

S = 1 

7. This means that each bus has 1 seat for each student, so there are 92 seats in each bus. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",92 seats in each bus.

gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,Danny collects bottle caps. He lost 66 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 25 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?,91.0,sbs,"Q: Danny collects bottle caps. He lost 66 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 25 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Danny lost 66 bottle caps at the park.
2. Now he has 25 bottle caps in his collection.
3. We want to know how many bottle caps Danny had at first.

To solve this problem, we need to use subtraction and addition. We know that Danny had some bottle caps at first, then he lost 66, and now he has 25. So:

Danny's original number of bottle caps - 66 (lost) + 25 (current) = total number of bottle caps

Let's use a variable to represent the unknown original number of bottle caps:

x - 66 + 25 = total number of bottle caps

Simplifying the equation:

x - 41 = total number of bottle caps

To find the total number of bottle caps, we need to add 41 to both sides of the equation:

x = total number of bottle caps + 41

Now we can see that Danny had x bottle caps at first, which is equal to the total number of bottle caps he has now (25) plus the number of bottle caps he lost (66), plus 41:

x = 25 + 66 + 41
x = 132

Therefore, Danny had 132 bottle caps at first. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",132

The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches. 

Second, we know that the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. Let's call the distance the frog jumped ""x"". Then, the grasshopper jumped x + 4 inches. 

Third, we know that the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. So, the mouse jumped x - 44 inches. 

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x: 

x + 4 (grasshopper's jump) + x (frog's jump) + x - 44 (mouse's jump) = total distance 

Simplifying this equation: 

3x - 40 = total distance - 19 

We don't know the total distance, but we can simplify the left side: 

3x - 40 = total distance - 19 

3x - 21 = total distance 

Now we can solve for x: 

3x - 21 = total distance 

3x - 21 = 19 + x + x - 44 

3x - 21 = 2x - 25 

x = 4

3. To find out how many pastries he still has, we need to subtract the number of pastries he sold from the total number of pastries he made.
4. Total number of pastries = 56
5. Number of pastries sold = 29
6. Number of pastries still left = Total number of pastries - Number of pastries sold
7. Number of pastries still left = 56 - 29
8. Number of pastries still left = 27

Therefore, Baker would still have 27 pastries left. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",27

If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes How many students suggested bacon?

A: Let's think step by step. Let's call the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes ""x"". 

According to the problem, we know that:

- 182 students suggested mashed potatoes
- Some other students suggested adding bacon
- The number of students who suggested bacon is 166 more than those who suggested mashed potatoes

So, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

x + (x + 166) = total number of students who suggested bacon

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x + 166 = total number of students who suggested bacon

Now, we also know that the total number of students who suggested food is the sum of those who suggested mashed potatoes and those who suggested bacon:

total number of students who suggested food = 182 + (2x + 166)

We can simplify this equation as well:

total number of students who suggested food = 348 + 2x

Finally, we know that the total number of students who suggested food is 182 + 166 = 348 (since every student who suggested food either suggested mashed potatoes or bacon). So we can set up one more equation:

total number of students who suggested food = 348

Now we have two equations with two variables:

total number of students who suggested food = 348 = 348 + 2x - 2x

total number of students who suggested food = 348 = 182 + (2x + 166)

Solving the first equation, we get:

0 = 0

This equation doesn't give us any new information, but it confirms that our equations are consistent.

Solving the second equation, we get:

166 = 2x

x = 83

So 83 students suggested mashed potatoes, and:

x + 166 = 83 + 166 = 249

249 students suggested bacon. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",249

There are now 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. How many more roses than orchids are there in the vase now?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with the initial number of roses and orchids in the vase.

Initial number of roses = 6
Initial number of orchids = 20

Step 2: Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden.

Let's say Jessica cut x roses and y orchids from her garden.

Number of roses after cutting = 6 + x
Number of orchids after cutting = 20 + y

Step 3: There are now 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase.

Number of roses after cutting = 22
Number of orchids after cutting = 21

So, we can write two equations based on the above information:

6 + x + y = 22   (equation 1)
20 + x + y = 21  (equation 2)

Simplifying equation 2, we get:

x + y = 1

Substituting this value in equation 1, we get:

6 + 1 = 22
x = 15

So, Jessica cut 15 roses from her garden.

Now, we can find the number of orchids after cutting:

20 + y = 21
y = 1

So, Jessica cut 1 orchid from her garden.

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of roses and orchids in the vase:

Number of roses = 22
Number of orchids = 21

Difference = 22 - 21 = 1

Therefore, there is only 1 more rose than orchid in the vase now. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1

5. Now we can substitute the third equation into the second equation to get H = (J + 8) + J + 9, which simplifies to H = 2J + 17.
6. We can also substitute the first equation into the fourth equation to get A = J + 8.
7. Now we can substitute the fourth equation into the first equation to get (J + 8) + J = 12, which simplifies to 2J + 8 = 12.
8. Solving for J, we get J = 2.
9. Using the fourth equation, we can find that A = J + 8 = 10.
10. Finally, using the fifth equation, we can find that H = 2J + 17 = 21.
11. Therefore, He has 21 apples. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",21

How many oranges are harvested if they harvest a total of 35 sacks of oranges?,420.0,sbs,"Q: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 67 sacks per day and that each sack containes 12 oranges. How many oranges are harvested if they harvest a total of 35 sacks of oranges?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many oranges are in one sack. We know that each sack contains 12 oranges, so:

12 oranges/sack

Next, we need to find out how many oranges are harvested in one day. We know that they harvest 67 sacks per day, so:

67 sacks/day x 12 oranges/sack = 804 oranges/day

Finally, we can use this information to find out how many oranges are harvested if they harvest a total of 35 sacks of oranges:

35 sacks x 12 oranges/sack = 420 oranges

Therefore, if they harvest a total of 35 sacks of oranges, they will harvest 420 oranges. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",420
gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 2 groups and oranges are organized into 93 groups How big is each group of bananas?,145.0,sbs,"Q: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 2 groups and oranges are organized into 93 groups How big is each group of bananas?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bananas are in each group. 

To do this, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups: 

290 bananas ÷ 2 groups = 145 bananas per group 

So each group of bananas has 145 bananas. 

Next, we need to find out how many oranges are in each group. 

To do this, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of groups: 

87 oranges ÷ 93 groups = 0.935 oranges per group 

Since we can't have a fraction of an orange, we can round this up to 1 orange per group. 

Therefore, each group of oranges has 1 orange and each group of bananas has 145 bananas. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1 orange per group and 145 bananas per group.
gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,There are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in Philip's collection.

If the bananas are organized into 345 groups and oranges are organized into 16 groups How big is each group of oranges?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that there are 384 oranges in Philip's collection and they are organized into 16 groups. 

2. To find out how big each group of oranges is, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of groups: 

   384 oranges ÷ 16 groups = 24 oranges per group 

3. Now let's look at the bananas. We know that there are 192 bananas in Philip's collection and they are organized into 345 groups. 

4. To find out how big each group of bananas is, we need to divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups: 

   192 bananas ÷ 345 groups = 0.556 bananas per group 

5. However, we cannot have a fraction of a banana in a group, so we need to round up or down. In this case, we will round down to 0 bananas per group. 

So, each group of oranges has 24 oranges and each group of bananas has 0 bananas. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",24 oranges per group.

If Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches How many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 27 to Zachary's 5 push-ups: 

5 + 27 = 32 push-ups for David 

2. Zachary did 7 less crunches than David, so we can subtract 7 from David's 17 crunches: 

17 - 7 = 10 crunches for Zachary 

3. Now we can compare the number of crunches and push-ups Zachary did: 

Zachary did 10 crunches and 5 push-ups. 

To find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did, we can subtract the number of push-ups from the number of crunches: 

10 - 5 = 5 

Therefore, Zachary did 5 more crunches than push-ups. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5

How many saltwater animals does Tyler have?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of animals in freshwater aquariums.
- Tyler has 74 freshwater aquariums.
- Each aquarium has 46 animals in it.
- So, the total number of animals in freshwater aquariums is 74 x 46 = 3404.

Step 2: Find the total number of animals in all aquariums.
- Tyler has 74 freshwater aquariums and 22 saltwater aquariums.
- Each aquarium has 46 animals in it.
- So, the total number of animals in all aquariums is (74 + 22) x 46 = 5520.

Step 3: Find the number of saltwater animals.
- We already know the total number of animals in all aquariums (5520).
- We also know the total number of animals in freshwater aquariums (3404).

The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 24 inches. 

Next, we know that the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper. So, we can add 33 to 24 to find out how far the frog jumped: 

24 + 33 = 57 

Therefore, the frog jumped 57 inches. 

Finally, we know that the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog. So, we can subtract 5 from 57 to find out how far the mouse jumped: 

57 - 5 = 52 

Therefore, the mouse jumped 52 inches. 

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we can subtract the distance the grasshopper jumped from the distance the mouse jumped: 

52 - 24 = 28 

Therefore, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",28

gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 392 pages and he read 14 pages per day. How many days did he take to finish the book?,28.0,sbs,"Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 392 pages and he read 14 pages per day. How many days did he take to finish the book?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pages Frank read in total. To do that, we can use multiplication:

14 pages/day x number of days = total pages read

Next, we need to figure out how many days it took Frank to finish the book. To do that, we can rearrange the formula above:

total pages read / 14 pages/day = number of days

Now, we just need to plug in the numbers we have:

total pages read = 392 pages
14 pages/day x number of days = 392 pages

Solving for number of days:

number of days = 392 pages / 14 pages/day
number of days = 28 days

Therefore, Frank took 28 days to finish his favorite book. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",28
gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 27 of his marbles at the playground while Ed found 9 more marbles. How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?,60.0,sbs,"Q: Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 27 of his marbles at the playground while Ed found 9 more marbles. How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug, so we can write:

Ed = Doug + 24

2. Doug lost 27 marbles, so we need to subtract 27 from his original number of marbles:

Doug - 27

3. Ed found 9 more marbles, so we need to add 9 to his original number of marbles:

Ed + 9

4. Now we can substitute the first equation into the second and third equations:

Doug - 27 = (Doug + 24) - 27
Ed + 9 = (Doug + 24) + 9

5. Simplifying these equations, we get:

Doug - 27 = Doug - 4
Ed + 9 = Doug + 33

6. Subtracting Doug from both sides of the first equation, we get:

-27 = -4

This is not true, so there must be an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

We made a mistake in step 4. We should have substituted the first equation into the third equation, not the second equation. Let's try again:

Doug - 27 = (Doug + 24) - 27
Ed + 9 = (Doug + 24) + 9

7. Simplifying these equations, we get:

Doug - 27 = Doug - 3
Ed + 9 = Doug + 33

8. Subtracting Doug from both sides of the first equation, we get:

-27 = -3

This is still not true, so there must be another error. Let's check our work again.

We made another mistake in step 7. We should have added 24 to Doug in the second equation, not 33. Let's try again:

Doug - 27 = (Doug + 24) - 27
Ed + 9 = (Doug + 24) + 9

9. Simplifying these equations, we get:

Doug - 27 = Doug - 3
Ed + 9 = Doug + 33

10. Subtracting Doug from both sides of the first equation, we get:

-27 = -3

This is still not true, so there must be another error. Let's check our work again.

We made another mistake in step 1. We should have written:

Doug = Ed - 24

Let's start over with the correct equation Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",24 more marbles.

We know that they sold a total of 186 t-shirts during both games, and 172 t-shirts were sold during the Arkansas game. So, we can subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold:

186 t-shirts (total) - 172 t-shirts (Arkansas game) = 14 t-shirts (Texas Tech game)

Now that we know they sold 14 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, we can find out how much money they made from selling those t-shirts. We know that they make $78 off each t-shirt sold, so we can multiply the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game by the amount of money made per t-shirt:

14 t-shirts (Texas Tech game) * $78 per t-shirt = $1092

How many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?,12.0,sbs,"Q: Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches in gym class today. David did 38 more push-ups but 62 less crunches than zachary. How many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches.
2. David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups.
3. David did 62 less crunches than Zachary, so he did 58 - 62 = -4 crunches. This doesn't make sense, as you can't do negative crunches.
4. Therefore, we made a mistake in step 3. Let's try again.
5. David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups.
6. David did 62 less crunches than Zachary, so he did 58 - 62 = -4 crunches. This still doesn't make sense.
7. Let's try a different approach. We know that Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches, so he did 58 - 46 = 12 more crunches than push-ups.
8. David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups.
9. David did 12 less crunches than Zachary (since Zachary did 12 more crunches than push-ups), so he did 58 - 12 = 46 crunches.
10. Therefore, Zachary did 12 more crunches than push-ups. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",12

If she spent 4 dollars. How much more money did she receive from her dad than she did from her mom?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Gwen received 3 dollars from her mom.
2. Her dad gave her 6 more dollars, so she had a total of 3 + 6 = 9 dollars.
3. She spent 4 dollars, so she had 9 - 4 = 5 dollars left.
4. To find out how much more money she received from her dad than from her mom, we need to subtract the initial amount from her dad's gift: 6 - 3 = 3 dollars.
5. Therefore, Gwen received 3 dollars more from her dad than from her mom. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3

How many houses are there in a block?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many pieces of junk mail the mailman gives to each house. We know that the mailman gives 2 junk mails to each house, so:

2 junk mails/house

Next, we need to figure out how many houses there are in a block. We know that the mailman has to give 14 pieces of junk mail to each block, so:

14 pieces of junk mail/block

To figure out how many houses there are in a block, we can divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the number of pieces of junk mail given to each house:

14 pieces of junk mail/block ÷ 2 junk mails/house = 7 houses/block

If Ed had 22 marbles How many marbles does Doug have now?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug, so we can write an equation: E = D + 6, where E is the number of marbles Ed has and D is the number of marbles Doug has.
2. We know that Ed had 22 marbles, so we can substitute E with 22: 22 = D + 6.
3. Solving for D, we subtract 6 from both sides: 16 = D.
4. Doug lost 7 of his marbles, so we subtract 7 from 16: 9.
5. Therefore, Doug now has 9 marbles. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Dan has $2.
2. He bought a candy bar for $6, so he now has $2 - $6 = -$4.
3. He also bought a chocolate for $3, so he now has -$4 - $3 = -$7.
4. To find out how much more he spent on the candy bar than the chocolate, we need to find the difference between the two prices: $6 - $3 = $3.
5. However, since Dan spent more money on the candy bar than he had in total, we can't really say that he spent $3 more on the candy bar than the chocolate. In fact, he spent $6 + $3 = $9 in total, which means he spent $6 more on the candy bar than the chocolate. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",$6.00

A: Let's think step by step. 1. The waiter had 3 customers.
2. After some left, he still had 4 customers.
3. This means that at least 1 customer stayed behind (since 3 - 1 = 2, which is less than 4).
4. To find out how many more customers stayed behind than those that left, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the number of customers who stayed behind.
5. Let's call the number of customers who left ""x"". Then the number of customers who stayed behind is ""x + 1"" (since we know at least 1 customer stayed behind).

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Baker made 19 cakes and 131 pastries.
2. Baker sold 70 cakes and 88 pastries.
3. To find out how many more pastries than cakes Baker made, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of cakes made, and subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of pastries made.
4. So, the calculation would be: 

    Number of pastries made = 131
    Number of pastries sold = 88
    Number of cakes made = 19
    Number of cakes sold = 70

    More pastries than cakes = (Number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold) - (Number of cakes made - Number of cakes sold)
    
    More pastries than cakes = (131 - 88) - (19 - 70)
    
    More pastries than cakes = 43 - (-51)
    
    More pastries than cakes = 94

Therefore, Baker made 94 more pastries than cakes. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",94

If he had 32 crackers and 98 cakes initially How many crackers did each person eat?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends, so he gave a total of 4 x (number of crackers and cakes given to each friend) crackers and cakes.
2. We know that he had 32 crackers and 98 cakes initially, so the total number of crackers and cakes he gave to his friends is 32 + 98 = 130.
3. To find out how many crackers each person ate, we need to divide the total number of crackers by the number of friends. Since he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes, we can assume that he gave the same number of crackers as cakes to each friend. Therefore, the number of crackers given to each friend is equal to the number of cakes given to each friend.
4. Dividing 130 by 4, we get 32.5. However, we cannot give half a cracker to each person, so we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each person ate 32 crackers. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",32 crackers.

How many apples does Bob have?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's start by using variables to represent the number of apples each person has. Let's call Adam's number of apples ""A"" and Jackie's number of apples ""J"". 

2. We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so we can write an equation: 

A = J + 4 

3. We also know that together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples, so we can write another equation: 

A + J = 14 

4. Now we need to find out how many apples Bob has. We know that Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together do, so we can write another equation: 

B = A + J + 6 

5. We can use the first two equations to solve for A and J: 

A = J + 4 

A + J = 14 

Substituting the first equation into the second equation: 

(J + 4) + J = 14 

2J + 4 = 14 

2J = 10 

J = 5 

So Jackie has 5 apples. 

Using the first equation, we can find that Adam has: 

A = J + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 

So Adam has 9 apples. 

6. Now we can use the third equation to find out how many apples Bob has: 

B = A + J + 6 = 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 

So Bob has 20 apples. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",20

To solve for the earnings per week, we can isolate the variable by dividing both sides by 19:

$133 ÷ 19 = Earnings per week

This simplifies to:

$7 = Earnings per week

Therefore, Lewis earns $7 per week. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",$7.00

Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 15 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?

A: Let's think step by step. First, Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase, so the number of roses in the vase decreased from 21 to 21 - 34 = -13. This doesn't make sense, as you can't have negative roses in a vase!

So, we need to adjust our approach. Let's start again with the information we have:

- There were 21 roses in the vase.
- Jessica threw away some roses from the vase.
- Jessica cut some new roses from her garden.
- There are now 15 roses in the vase.

To find out how many roses Jessica threw away more than those she cut from her garden, we need to figure out how many roses she cut from her garden in the first place.

We know that the total number of roses in the vase decreased from 21 to 15, which means that Jessica threw away 21 - 15 = 6 roses.

Let's call the number of roses Jessica cut from her garden ""x"". We can set up an equation to represent the total number of roses in the vase after Jessica cut some new ones and threw away some old ones:

21 - 34 + x = 15

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = 28

So Jessica cut 28 new roses from her garden. Now we can answer the original question: how many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?

Jessica threw away 6 roses, and she cut 28 roses from her garden. Therefore, she threw away 28 - 6 = 22 more roses than those she cut from her garden. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",22

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's start by using variables to represent the unknowns. Let's call the number of apples Adam has ""A"" and the number of apples Jackie has ""J"". We know that A + J = 6, since together they have 6 apples.

2. We also know that ""he"" (presumably someone other than Adam or Jackie) has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie together. Let's call the number of apples ""he"" has ""H"". Then we can write an equation: H = A + J + 4.

3. Now we can use the first equation to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Let's solve for J: J = 6 - A.

4. We can substitute this expression for J into the second equation: H = A + (6 - A) + 4.

5. Simplifying this equation, we get: H = 10 - A.

6. Now we have two equations for H: H = A + J + 4 and H = 10 - A. We can set them equal to each other: A + J + 4 = 10 - A.

7. Substituting J = 6 - A, we get: A + (6 - A) + 4 = 10 - A.

8. Simplifying this equation, we get: 10 = 2A + 4.

9. Solving for A, we get: A = 3.

10. Using the equation J = 6 - A, we get: J = 3.

11. Finally, we can use either equation for H to find the answer. Using H = A + J + 4, we get: H = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10.

Therefore, ""he"" has 10 apples. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10

4. According to step 2, the number of girls is 281 more than the number of boys, so we can write an equation: 868 = x + 281
5. We can solve for x by subtracting 281 from both sides: x = 587
6. Now we know that there are 587 boys in the school.
7. To find the total number of pupils, we can add the number of girls and boys: 868 + 587 = 1455

There were 87 bird families living near the mountain. If 7 bird families flew away for winter How many more bird families stayed behind than those that flew away for the winter?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find out how many bird families flew away for winter.
7 bird families flew away for winter.

Step 2: Find out how many bird families stayed behind.
To do this, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the total number of bird families.
Total number of bird families = 87
Number of bird families that flew away = 7
Number of bird families that stayed behind = 87 - 7 = 80

Step 3: Find out how many more bird families stayed behind than those that flew away for the winter.
To do this, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the number of bird families that stayed behind.
Number of bird families that stayed behind = 80

gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,"Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 3 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 594 pages. It took Frank 607 days to finish the book. How many pages are in each chapter?",198.0,sbs,"Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 3 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 594 pages. It took Frank 607 days to finish the book. How many pages are in each chapter?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula:

total pages = number of chapters x pages per chapter

Since we know the total pages and the number of chapters (3), we can solve for the pages per chapter:

594 = 3 x pages per chapter

pages per chapter = 594 / 3

pages per chapter = 198

So each chapter has 198 pages.

Now, let's use the fact that it took Frank 607 days to finish the book. We can set up another formula:

time to finish book = time per chapter x number of chapters

Since each chapter has the same number of pages, we can assume that Frank spent the same amount of time reading each chapter. Let's call this time per chapter ""t"". Then:

607 = t x 3

t = 607 / 3

t = 202.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

So Frank spent about 202.33 days reading each chapter.

To check our answer, we can multiply the pages per chapter by the time per chapter:

198 x 202.33 = 40000.34 (rounded to two decimal places)

This is the total number of pages Frank would have read if he spent exactly 202.33 days reading each chapter. Since the actual total is 594 pages, our answer is reasonable. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",198 pages per chapter.

If her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide How much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the room to know how much carpet we need in total. 

Area of the room = length x width 

Area of the room = 4 feet x 20 feet 

Area of the room = 80 square feet 

Now we know that we need 80 square feet of carpet to cover the whole floor. 

However, Jesse already has 18 square feet of carpet. 

So, the amount of carpet she still needs = total carpet needed - carpet she already has 

Amount of carpet she still needs = 80 square feet - 18 square feet 

Amount of carpet she still needs = 62 square feet 

Therefore, Jesse still needs 62 square feet of carpet to cover the whole floor. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",62

She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 55 Ace cards and 178 baseball cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 Ace cards.
2. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so we don't know how many cards she has now.
3. We do know that she has 55 Ace cards and 178 baseball cards left.
4. To find out how many cards she gave to Jeff, we can subtract the number of cards she has now from the total number of cards she had before: 

Total cards = 438 + 18 = 456
Cards left after giving some to Jeff = 55 + 178 = 233
Cards given to Jeff = 456 - 233 = 223

5. Now we can find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has:

Baseball cards = 178
Ace cards = 55

If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends and still had 17 crackers left How many crackers did Matthew give to his friends?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Matthew had 24 crackers.
2. He gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends.
3. After giving crackers to his friends, he still had 17 crackers left.

To find out how many crackers Matthew gave to his friends, we can use subtraction. We know that he started with 24 crackers and ended up with 17, so he must have given away 7 crackers. 

Now we need to divide those 7 crackers equally among his 3 friends. We can use division to find out how many crackers each friend received. 

7 crackers ÷ 3 friends = 2 remainder 1

This means that each friend received 2 crackers, and Matthew had 1 cracker left over. 

So the answer is: Matthew gave 2 crackers to each of his 3 friends, for a total of 6 crackers, and he had 1 cracker left over. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6 crackers.

The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 21 inches. 

Second, we know that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog. Let's call the distance the frog jumped ""x"". Then, the grasshopper jumped x + 25 inches. 

Third, we know that the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. So, the mouse jumped x - 16 inches. 

Now, we need to find out how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse. 

Distance grasshopper jumped = x + 25 

Distance mouse jumped = x - 16 

To find the difference, we can subtract the distance the mouse jumped from the distance the grasshopper jumped: 

(x + 25) - (x - 16) 

Simplifying: 

x + 25 - x + 16 

The ""x"" terms cancel out, leaving us with: 

25 + 16 = 41 

Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 41 inches farther than the mouse. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",41

If there were 471 visitors the previous day and 808 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace within the past 89 days?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace in the past three days:

- 512 visitors today
- 471 visitors yesterday
- 808 visitors the day before yesterday

To find the total number of visitors in the past three days, we add these numbers:

512 + 471 + 808 = 1791

So, 1791 visitors came to the Buckingham palace in the past three days.

Next, we need to find out how many visitors came to the palace in the past 89 days. We can use proportions to do this.

If 1791 visitors came in the past three days, then how many visitors came in one day on average?

To find out, we divide 1791 by 3:

1791 / 3 = 597

If he has 27 books and 80 magazines in each of his 23 bookshelves How many books does he have in total?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many books Bryan has in one bookshelf. We know that he has 27 books and 80 magazines in each of his 23 bookshelves, so we can use this information to find out:

27 books + 80 magazines = 107 items in one bookshelf

Now we know that each bookshelf has 107 items, but we want to know how many of those items are books. We can use a proportion to find out:

27 books / 107 items = x books / 1 bookshelf

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

27 books * 1 bookshelf = 107 items * x books

27 books = 107 items * x books / 1 bookshelf

27 books = 107x books

x = 27 books / 107

x = 0.2523 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, in one bookshelf, Bryan has approximately 0.2523 * 107 = 27 books.

Finally, to find out how many books he has in total, we can multiply the number of books in one bookshelf by the number of bookshelves:

How much did they make per day?,33.0,sbs,"Q: The ring toss game at the carnival made the same amount of money each day. In total in 5 days they earned 165 dollars. How much did they make per day?

A: Let's think step by step. We know that the ring toss game made the same amount of money each day, so let's call that amount ""x"". 

We also know that in 5 days, they earned a total of 165 dollars. 

So we can set up an equation: 

5x = 165 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5: 

x = 33 

Therefore, they made $33 per day from the ring toss game at the carnival. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",33
gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,There were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. How many more roses than orchids are there in the vase now?,10.0,sbs,"Q: There were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. How many more roses than orchids are there in the vase now?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with the initial number of roses and orchids in the vase.

Initial number of roses = 5
Initial number of orchids = 3

Step 2: Add the number of roses and orchids that Jessica cut from her garden.

Let's say Jessica cut x roses and y orchids.

New number of roses = 5 + x
New number of orchids = 3 + y

Step 3: Use the information given in the problem to form an equation.

According to the problem, there are now 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. So we can write:

New number of roses = 12
New number of orchids = 2

Step 4: Solve for x and y.

From Step 2, we know that:

New number of roses = 5 + x
New number of orchids = 3 + y

Substituting the values from Step 3, we get:

12 = 5 + x
2 = 3 + y

Solving for x and y, we get:

x = 7
y = -1

Step 5: Answer the question.

The problem asks us to find the difference between the number of roses and orchids in the vase now. From Step 2, we know that:

New number of roses = 5 + x = 5 + 7 = 12
New number of orchids = 3 + y = 3 - 1 = 2

So there are 12 - 2 = 10 more roses than orchids in the vase now. 

Therefore, the answer is 10. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10

If you read 11 of the books and watched 40 of the movies How many more books than movies are there in the ' crazy silly school ' series?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know there are 14 movies and 15 books in the series.
2. The question asks us to find the difference between the number of books and movies.
3. We know that the number of books read is 11 and the number of movies watched is 40.
4. To find the difference, we need to subtract the number of movies from the number of books: 

15 books - 14 movies = 1 more book than movie

5. However, we also need to take into account the number of books and movies that have been read/watched: 

15 books - 11 books = 4 books left to read
14 movies - 40 movies = 26 movies left to watch

6. So, the final answer is: 

There is 1 more book than movie in the 'crazy silly school' series, but there are 4 more books left to read than movies left to watch. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1

There are now 23 roses in the vase. How many roses were there in the vase at the beginning?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Let's start by using algebra to represent the problem. Let's call the number of roses in the vase at the beginning ""x"". 

2. Jessica cut 16 more roses from her flower garden, so we can add 16 to x: 

x + 16 

3. Jessica put all these roses in the vase, so now there are 23 roses in the vase. We can set up an equation: 

x + 16 = 23

The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?",58.0,sbs,"Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches. 

Next, we need to find out how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper. We're told that the frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can add 39 to 19: 

19 + 39 = 58 

So the frog jumped 58 inches. 

Finally, we need to find out how much less the mouse jumped than the frog. We're told that the mouse jumped 94 inches less than the frog, so we can subtract 94 from 58: 

58 - 94 = -36 

Uh oh, that doesn't make sense! How can the mouse jump a negative distance? 

We made a mistake earlier when we added 39 to 19. We should have added 39 to the total distance the grasshopper jumped, not just to the 19 inches. So let's start over: 

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. 

The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we add 39 to 19: 

19 + 39 = 58 

So the frog jumped 58 inches. 

The mouse jumped 94 inches less than the frog, so we subtract 94 from 58: 

58 - 94 = -36 

Wait, we still got a negative number! That means the mouse didn't jump at all, or maybe even went backwards. 

Let's check our work. We know that the frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the total distance the frog jumped should be: 

19 + 39 = 58 

That checks out. 

But then we're told that the mouse jumped 94 inches less than the frog. If the frog jumped 58 inches, then the mouse should have jumped: 

58 - 94 = -36 

Uh oh, we made another mistake. We should have subtracted 94 from the distance the grasshopper jumped, not the frog. 

So let's start over again: 

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. 

The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we add 39 to 19: 

19 + 39 = 58 

So the frog jumped 58 inches. 

The mouse jumped 94 inches less than the grasshopper, so we subtract 94 from 19: 

19 - 94 Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","-75. 

So the mouse jumped 75 inches less than the grasshopper. 

To summarize: 

- Grasshopper jumped 19 inches 
- Frog jumped 58 inches 
- Mouse jumped 75 inches less than the grasshopper (or -75 inches)"

There, Rachel learned that 132 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If 406 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 327 days How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day?

A: Let's think step by step. 1. We know that 132 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the day Rachel visited.
2. We also know that 406 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 327 days.
3. To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors on Rachel's day from the total number of visitors in the past 327 days.
4. So, we can calculate: 

    Total visitors in the past 327 days - Visitors on Rachel's day = Visitors on the previous day

5. To do this calculation, we need to first find out the average number of visitors per day in the past 327 days. We can do this by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days:

    Average visitors per day = Total visitors / Number of days
                            = 406 / 327
                            = 1.24 (rounded to two decimal places)

6. Now we can use this average to estimate the number of visitors on the previous day. Let's call this number ""x"":

    x + 132 = 2.48   (since the average is 1.24 visitors per day for the past 327 days)
    x = 2.48 - 132
    x = -129.52

7. This result doesn't make sense, because we can't have negative visitors. So, we need to adjust our calculation. One possibility is that the number of visitors on Rachel's day was significantly higher or lower than the average. Let's assume that it was higher, say 150 visitors. Then we can recalculate:

    Total visitors in the past 327 days - Visitors on Rachel's day = Visitors on the previous day
    406 - 150 = 256

So, we estimate that there were 256 visitors on the previous day. However, this is just an estimate based on assumptions. Without more information, we can't be sure of the exact number. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",256

How many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of campers who went rowing.

To find the total number of campers who went rowing, we need to add the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon.

Number of campers who went rowing = 29 (morning) + 26 (afternoon) = 55

Step 2: Find the difference between the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and the afternoon.

To find the difference between the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon from the number of campers who went rowing in the morning.

He was told by 252 of the pickers that they fill 108 drums of grapes per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pickers there are in total. We know that 252 pickers told him about the grape production, but we don't know if that's all of them. Let's assume that all the pickers told him, so:

Total number of pickers = 252

Next, we need to find out how many drums of grapes are filled in one day by all the pickers. We know that 108 drums are filled by the 252 pickers, so we can set up a proportion:

108 drums / 252 pickers = x drums / total number of pickers

Solving for x, we get:

x = (108 drums / 252 pickers) * total number of pickers
x = (108/252) * 252
x = 108 drums

So, all the pickers fill 108 drums of grapes per day.

Finally, we can find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days. Since we know that 108 drums are filled in one day, we can multiply that by the number of days:

Total drums of grapes = 108 drums/day * 58 days
Total drums of grapes = 6,264 drums

Therefore, in 58 days, the pickers would fill 6,264 drums of grapes. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","6,264.00"

If there are a total of 12 peaches in all baskets How many green peaches are in each basket?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that each basket has 4 red peaches. So, the total number of red peaches in both baskets is 4 + 4 = 8.

Next, we know that the total number of peaches in both baskets is 12. So, if we subtract the number of red peaches (8) from the total number of peaches (12), we get the number of green peaches in both baskets: 12 - 8 = 4.

Finally, we want to know how many green peaches are in each basket. Since we know that there are 4 green peaches in both baskets combined, we can divide that by the number of baskets (2) to get the number of green peaches in each basket: 4 ÷ 2 = 2.

Therefore, each basket has 2 green peaches. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2

x = total amount of wax - 375 

We don't know the exact total amount of wax, but we do know that he needs a total of 57 g of colors to paint the feathers. So let's call the total amount of wax and colors combined ""y"": 

x + 57 = y 

Substituting the previous equation for ""x"": 

total amount of wax - 375 + 57 = y 

Simplifying: 

total amount of wax - 318 = y 

So the answer is that he already has ""total amount of wax - 318"" grams of wax. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",not possible to determine without knowing the total amount of wax.

There were 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of visitors in 2 days (the day Rachel visited and the previous day). 

The number of visitors on the day Rachel visited is 557, and the number of visitors the previous day is 188. So, the total number of visitors in 2 days is 557 + 188 = 745 visitors. 

Now, we need to find the average number of visitors per day. To do this, we will divide the total number of visitors in 2 days by 2: 

745 visitors / 2 days = 372.5 visitors per day (on average)

Finally, we need to find the total number of visitors within 57 days. To do this, we will multiply the average number of visitors per day by 57 days: 

372.5 visitors/day * 57 days = 21232.5 visitors

Since we cannot have a fraction of a visitor, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. So, approximately 21,233 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 57 days. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",21233

How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?,1.0,sbs,"Q: Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven who has 11 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 4 peaches. How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Steven has 4 peaches. Since Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill, we can write this as:

Steven's peaches = Jill's peaches + 11

Now we can plug in the number of peaches Steven has:

4 = Jill's peaches + 11

To find out how many peaches Jill has, we can subtract 11 from both sides of the equation:

4 - 11 = Jill's peaches

So, Jill has -7 peaches. (This doesn't make sense in reality, but let's continue with the problem.)

Now, we know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. We can write this as:

Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 12

We can plug in the number of peaches Steven has:

Jake's peaches = 4 - 12

So, Jake has -8 peaches.

Finally, we want to find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake. We can write this as:

Difference = Jill's peaches - Jake's peaches

Plugging in the values we found:

Difference = -7 - (-8)

Difference = -7 + 8

Difference = 1

So, Jill has 1 more peach than Jake. However, since it's impossible to have a negative number of peaches, this problem doesn't make sense in reality. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1

However, it should be the other way around: you read 14 of the books and watched 19 of the movies. But there are only 10 books and 6 movies in the series. So, you must have read all 10 books and watched all 6 movies.

Now, to find out how many more books than movies you have read, we simply subtract the number of movies from the number of books:

10 books - 6 movies = 4

So, you have read 4 more books than movies in the 'crazy silly school' series. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4

gpt-4-0314,A waiter had 11 customers. After some left he still had 3 customers. How many more customers left than those that stayed behind?,5.0,sbs,"Q: A waiter had 11 customers. After some left he still had 3 customers. How many more customers left than those that stayed behind?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the waiter had 11 customers and some left. Let's call the number of customers who left L. So, we can write the equation:

11 - L = 3

Now, we need to find L. To do this, we can add L to both sides of the equation:

11 - L + L = 3 + L

This simplifies to:

11 = 3 + L

Now, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

11 - 3 = 3 + L - 3

This simplifies to:

8 = L

So, 8 customers left. Now, we need to find how many more customers left than those that stayed behind. We know that 3 customers stayed behind, so we can subtract this number from the number of customers who left:

8 - 3 = 5

So, 5 more customers left than those that stayed behind. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5

Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Marco and his dad collected 22 pounds of strawberries together. Then, Marco's dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries. So, the total weight of strawberries they have now is 22 + 30 = <<22+30=52>>52 pounds.

Now, we know that Marco's strawberries weigh 36 pounds. To find out how much his dad's strawberries weigh now, we can subtract the weight of Marco's strawberries from the total weight of strawberries they have. So, the weight of his dad's strawberries now is 52 - 36 = <<52-36=16>>16 pounds. Answer: \boxed{16}. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",16

If she had grown 3 trees initially How many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many trees survived the typhoon. Since Haley had initially grown 3 trees, and 13 trees died in the typhoon, there must have been a total of 3 + 13 = <<3+13=16>>16 trees in her backyard before the typhoon.

Now, we know that 13 trees died, so the number of trees that survived is 16 - 13 = <<16-13=3>>3 trees.

Finally, we need to find the difference between the number of trees that died and the number of trees that survived. This is 13 - 3 = <<13-3=10>>10 trees. So, 10 more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crayons Paul lost during the school year. To do this, we subtract the number of crayons he had left (336) from the number he started with (601): 601 - 336 = 265 crayons lost.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of erasers and the number of crayons he had left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had 406 erasers. So, we subtract the number of crayons left (336) from the number of erasers (406): 406 - 336 = 70.

Paul had 70 more erasers than crayons left at the end of the school year. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",70

After selling some in a garage sale he bought 38 new ones. If he has 116 books now How many more books did he buy than he sold?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many books Paul sold. We know that he had 71 books and now has 116 books after buying 38 new ones. So, we can write an equation:

71 - number_of_books_sold + 38 = 116

Now, we need to solve for the number_of_books_sold. We can start by combining the numbers:

So, the equation becomes:

109 - number_of_books_sold = 116

Now, we can subtract 109 from both sides of the equation to find the number_of_books_sold:

number_of_books_sold = 116 - 109

number_of_books_sold = 7

Now we know that Paul sold 7 books. We also know that he bought 38 new books. To find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we can subtract the number of books he sold from the number of books he bought:

38 - 7 = 31

Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 17 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she cut than those she threw away?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many roses Jessica threw away. Since there were 15 roses in the vase and she threw away 33 roses, this is not possible. So, we need to correct the information.

Let's assume Jessica threw away 3 roses instead of 33. Now, there were 15 roses in the vase, and she threw away 3 roses, leaving 15 - 3 = 12 roses in the vase.

Next, she cut some more roses from her flower garden and put them in the vase. Now there are 17 roses in the vase. So, she must have cut 17 - 12 = 5 roses from her flower garden.

112 - 49 = x

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 63

So, Fred earned 63 dollars by washing cars.

Now, we need to find out how much money Jason earned by delivering newspapers. We know that he had 3 dollars last week and now has 63 dollars. So, we can write the equation:

How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many push-ups David did. Since he did 39 more than Zachary, we can write the equation: 

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 39

Now we know that Zachary did 15 push-ups, so we can plug that into the equation:

David's push-ups = 15 + 39

David's push-ups = 54

Now we need to find out how many push-ups John did. Since he did 9 less than David, we can write the equation:

John's push-ups = David's push-ups - 9

We know that David did 54 push-ups, so we can plug that into the equation:

John's push-ups = 54 - 9

John's push-ups = 45

Now we can find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John. We can write the equation:

More push-ups = Zachary's push-ups - John's push-ups

We know that Zachary did 15 push-ups and John did 45 push-ups, so we can plug those numbers into the equation:

More push-ups = 15 - 45

More push-ups = -30

Since the result is negative, that means Zachary actually did 30 fewer push-ups than John. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",30

How many marbles did Doug lose?,17.0,sbs,"Q: Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's represent the number of marbles Doug had originally as D and the number of marbles Ed had originally as E. We know that Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so we can write this as:

E = D + 2

Now, Doug lost some marbles, and Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. Let's represent the number of marbles Doug has now as D' and the number of marbles Ed has now as E'. We know that E' = D' + 19.

However, Ed didn't lose any marbles, so E = E'. Similarly, the number of marbles Doug had originally (D) minus the number of marbles he lost (L) is equal to the number of marbles he has now (D'), so D - L = D'.

Now we can substitute E for E' and D - L for D' in the equation E' = D' + 19:

E = (D - L) + 19

We also know that E = D + 2, so we can substitute D + 2 for E in the equation above:

D + 2 = (D - L) + 19

Now we can solve for L:

D + 2 = D - L + 19
L = D - D + 19 - 2
L = 17

So Doug lost 17 marbles. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",17

If he has to pay $ 216 rent every week How much money will have at the end of the harvest season?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Lewis earns during the entire harvest season. To do this, we multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the harvest season:

$491 * 1181 = $580,071

Next, we need to find out how much money Lewis spends on rent during the entire harvest season. To do this, we multiply his weekly rent by the number of weeks in the harvest season:

$216 * 1181 = $255,096

Finally, we subtract the total amount Lewis spends on rent from the total amount he earns to find out how much money he will have at the end of the harvest season:

$580,071 - $255,096 = $324,975

Now he has 28 bottle caps and 16 wrappers in his collection. How many more bottle caps than wrappers does danny have now?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps and wrappers Danny has in total. To do this, we add the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park to the number he already had in his collection.

For bottle caps: 71 (found at the park) + 28 (already in his collection) = 99 bottle caps

For wrappers: 24 (found at the park) + 16 (already in his collection) = 40 wrappers

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers. To do this, we subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps.

Difference: 99 bottle caps - 40 wrappers = 59

So, Danny has 59 more bottle caps than wrappers in his collection. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",59

Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there were 5 children on the bus initially. Then, 63 children got off the bus. So, we need to subtract 63 from 5 to find out how many children were left on the bus after the first group got off: 5 - 63 = -58. This means that there were -58 children on the bus, which is not possible. So, we need to add some children to the bus to make the total number of children 14.

Now, we need to find out how many children got on the bus to make the total number of children 14. To do this, we can add the number of children that got on the bus (let's call this number x) to the -58 children that were left on the bus after the first group got off: -58 + x = 14.

Now, we can solve for x: x = 14 + 58 = 72. So, 72 children got on the bus.

Finally, we need to find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off. To do this, we can subtract the number of children that got off the bus (63) from the number of children that got on the bus (72): 72 - 63 = 9.

So, 9 more children got on the bus than those that got off. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9

There are 46 school buses and a total of 92 students in the school. If all buses are full How many seats are in each bus?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in each classroom. To do this, we can divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms:

92 students / 17 classrooms = 5.41 students per classroom (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, let's round up to 6 students per classroom. This means there are a total of 6 students * 17 classrooms = 102 students in the school.

Now, we need to find out how many seats are in each bus. To do this, we can divide the total number of students by the number of buses:

102 students / 46 buses = 2.22 seats per bus (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a seat, let's round up to 3 seats per bus. This means there are a total of 3 seats * 46 buses = 138 seats on all the buses.

However, we made some rounding errors in our calculations, so the actual number of seats per bus might be slightly different. To get a more accurate answer, we can divide the total number of seats by the number of buses:

138 seats / 46 buses = 3 seats per bus

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many books Paul had after selling some in the garage sale. To do this, we can use the information that he bought 42 new books and now has 15 books. So, we can write the equation:

Books after garage sale + 42 = 15

Now, we can solve for the number of books after the garage sale:

Books after garage sale = 15 - 42 = -27

Since it's impossible to have a negative number of books, this means that Paul actually sold more books than he bought. So, let's change the equation to:

Books after garage sale - 42 = 15

Now, we can solve for the number of books after the garage sale:

Books after garage sale = 15 + 42 = 57

Now that we know Paul had 57 books after the garage sale, we can find out how many books he sold. We know that he started with 21 books, so we can write the equation:

21 - Books sold = 57

Now, we can solve for the number of books sold:

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many more roses and orchids Jessica cut from her garden. 

She had 20 orchids and now has 21, so she cut 21 - 20 = <<21-20=1>>1 more orchid.
She had 6 roses and now has 22, so she cut 22 - 6 = <<22-6=16>>16 more roses.

Now, let's find out how many more roses than orchids are in the vase. 

There are 22 roses and 21 orchids, so there are 22 - 21 = <<22-21=1>>1 more rose than orchids in the vase now. Answer: \boxed{1}. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1

How many apples did the tree have to begin with?

A: Let's think step by step. First, Rachel picked 7 apples, so the tree had 7 apples less than it originally had. Then, 2 new apples grew, so the tree gained 2 apples. Now, the tree has 6 apples. To find out how many apples the tree had to begin with, we need to reverse these steps.

So, we start with the 6 apples the tree has now. Since the tree gained 2 apples, we subtract those 2 apples to find out how many apples were on the tree before they grew: 6 - 2 = 4 apples.

Now, we know there were 4 apples on the tree after Rachel picked 7 apples. To find out how many apples were on the tree before Rachel picked them, we add those 7 apples back: 4 + 7 = 11 apples.

So, the tree had 11 apples to begin with. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",11

How many more apps than files does he have left on the phone?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many apps Dave deleted. He had 15 apps and then had 21 apps, so he must have deleted 15 - 21 = -6 apps. This means he actually added 6 apps instead of deleting them.

Now let's find out how many files Dave deleted. He had 24 files and then had 4 files, so he must have deleted 24 - 4 = 20 files.

Now we need to find the difference between the number of apps and files left on his phone. He has 21 apps and 4 files, so he has 21 - 4 = <<21-4=17>>17 more apps than files left on his phone. Answer: \boxed{17}. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",17

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many more cups of flour Mary added than the recipe calls for. She added 12 cups, and the recipe calls for 6 cups, so she added 12 - 6 = <<12-6=6>>6 more cups of flour.

Now, we need to find out how many cups of sugar and salt she needs to add to match the extra flour. Since she added 6 more cups of flour, she needs to add 6 more cups of sugar and salt as well. So, she needs to add 11 + 6 = <<11+6=17>>17 cups of sugar and 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 cups of salt.

Finally, we need to find the difference between the cups of sugar and cups of salt she needs to add. The difference is 17 - 15 = <<17-15=2>>2 cups. So, Mary needs to add 2 more cups of sugar than cups of salt. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2

Now, we need to find out how many cards Nell has left after giving some to Jeff. To do this, we add the number of baseball cards and Ace cards she has left: 111 baseball cards + 376 Ace cards = <<111+376=487>>487 cards.

Next, we need to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. To do this, we subtract the number of cards she has left from the number of cards she had before: 277 cards - 487 cards = -210 cards. Since the result is negative, it means that Nell actually received cards from Jeff, not gave them to him. So, Nell received 210 cards from Jeff.

Now, we need to find out how many more Ace cards than baseball cards Nell has. To do this, we subtract the number of baseball cards she has left from the number of Ace cards she has left: 376 Ace cards - 111 baseball cards = <<376-111=265>>265 more Ace cards.

How many apples does He have?,21.0,sbs,"Q: Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's use the information that Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. Let A be the number of apples Adam has and J be the number of apples Jackie has. So, A = J + 8.

Next, we know that together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. So, A + J = 12.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to find the number of apples Jackie has: (J + 8) + J = 12. This simplifies to 2J + 8 = 12.

To solve for J, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 2J = 4. Then, we can divide both sides by 2 to find that J = 2.

Now that we know Jackie has 2 apples, we can use the first equation to find the number of apples Adam has: A = 2 + 8 = 10.

Finally, we know that He has 9 more apples than Adam and Jackie together. Since Adam and Jackie have 12 apples together, He has 12 + 9 = 21 apples. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",21

How many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many push-ups and crunches David did. We know that David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can write that as:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 38
David's push-ups = 46 + 38
David's push-ups = 84

Now, we know that David did 62 less crunches than Zachary, so we can write that as:

David's crunches = Zachary's crunches - 62
David's crunches = 58 - 62
David's crunches = -4

However, it doesn't make sense for David to do a negative number of crunches. There might be an error in the problem statement or we might have misunderstood the question. Assuming the problem statement is correct, let's continue with the given information.

Now, we need to find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did. We can write that as:

More crunches = Zachary's crunches - Zachary's push-ups

gpt-4-0314,Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?,20.0,sbs,"Q: Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many apples Adam and Jackie have individually. Let A be the number of apples Adam has and J be the number of apples Jackie has. We know that A = J + 4 and A + J = 14.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation: (J + 4) + J = 14. Simplifying this equation, we get 2J + 4 = 14.

Now we can solve for J: 2J = 10, so J = 5. Since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.

Now we know that Adam and Jackie together have 14 apples. Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so Bob has 14 + 6 = 20 apples. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",20

She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar How many more cups of flour does she need to add?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Mary still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. Let x be the number of cups of sugar she still needs to add. Then, the number of cups of flour she still needs to add is x + 8.

Now, we know that the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. Since she already put in some cups of flour, let's say she put in y cups of flour. Then, she still needs to add (6 - y) cups of flour.

We can now set up an equation:

x + 8 = 6 - y

We also know that she still needs to add x cups of sugar, so:

x = 13 - x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 6.5

Now, we can plug this value back into the equation for the number of cups of flour she still needs to add:

x + 8 = 6.5 + 8 = 14.5

So, Mary still needs to add 14.5 more cups of flour. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",14.5.

If Jill has 12 peaches How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill. Since Jill has 12 peaches, Steven has 12 + 15 = <<12+15=27>>27 peaches.

Next, we know that Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven. Since Steven has 27 peaches, Jake has 27 - 16 = <<27-16=11>>11 peaches.

Now, we want to find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake. Since Jill has 12 peaches and Jake has 11 peaches, Jill has 12 - 11 = <<12-11=1>>1 more peach than Jake. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crackers Matthew gave away in total. To do this, we subtract the number of crackers he has left from the number of crackers he started with: 31 - 23 = <<31-23=8>>8 crackers.

Now we know that Matthew gave away 8 crackers in total. Since he gave an equal number of crackers to each of his 5 friends, we can find out how many crackers each friend received by dividing the total number of crackers given away by the number of friends: 8 / 5 = <<8/5=1.6>>1.6 crackers per friend.

However, since it's not possible to give away a fraction of a cracker, we can conclude that there is an error in the problem statement or that it is not possible for Matthew to have given an equal number of crackers to each of his 5 friends. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",not possible.

If together their strawberries weighed 26 pounds. How much more did his dad's strawberries weigh than his?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds and together with his dad's strawberries, they weighed 26 pounds. So, we can write this as:

Marco's strawberries + Dad's strawberries = Total weight
10 + Dad's strawberries = 26

Now, we need to find out how much more did his dad's strawberries weigh than his. To do this, we can subtract Marco's strawberries from the total weight:

Dad's strawberries = Total weight - Marco's strawberries
Dad's strawberries = 26 - 10
Dad's strawberries = 16

So, his dad's strawberries weighed 16 pounds. Now, we can find the difference between their weights:

Difference = Dad's strawberries - Marco's strawberries
Difference = 16 - 10
Difference = 6

Therefore, his dad's strawberries weighed 6 pounds more than Marco's strawberries. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6

She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 55 Ace cards and 178 baseball cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. To do this, we can subtract the number of cards she has left from the number of cards she had before.

For baseball cards, she had 438 and now has 178 left, so she gave away 438 - 178 = <<438-178=260>>260 baseball cards.

For Ace cards, she had 18 and now has 55 left, so she gave away 18 - 55 = -37 Ace cards. Since it's not possible to give away a negative number of cards, this means that she actually received 37 Ace cards from someone else.

Now we can find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has. She has 178 baseball cards and 55 Ace cards, so she has 178 - 55 = <<178-55=123>>123 more baseball cards than Ace cards. Answer: \boxed{123}. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",123

If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends and still had 17 crackers left How many crackers did Matthew give to his friends?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crackers Matthew gave away in total. To do this, we subtract the number of crackers he has left (17) from the total number of crackers he had (24). So, 24 - 17 = 7 crackers.

Now, we know that Matthew gave away 7 crackers in total, and he gave an equal number of crackers to each of his 3 friends. To find out how many crackers each friend received, we simply divide the total number of crackers given away (7) by the number of friends (3). So, 7 ÷ 3 = 2.33 crackers.

However, since it's not possible to give away a fraction of a cracker, we can conclude that Matthew gave 2 crackers to two of his friends and 3 crackers to the third friend. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","2, 2, 3"

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the mouse jump?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far the frog jumped. Since the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, we can write the equation:

Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - 19 inches

Now we can plug in the grasshopper's jump:

Frog's jump = 39 inches - 19 inches

Frog's jump = 20 inches

Now we know the frog jumped 20 inches. Since the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog, we can write the equation:

Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 12 inches

Now we can plug in the frog's jump:

Mouse's jump = 20 inches - 12 inches

Mouse's jump = 8 inches

So the mouse jumped 8 inches. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8

There, Rachel learned that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If 829 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 829 people visited the palace within the past 85 days. We also know that 45 visitors came on the previous day. So, we need to find out how many visitors visited the palace on the current day.

To do this, we can subtract the number of visitors from the previous day (45) from the total number of visitors in the past 85 days (829).

829 - 45 = 784

Now, we know that 784 visitors visited the palace in the past 84 days (since we have removed the previous day's visitors). To find out how many visitors visited the palace on the current day, we can divide the total number of visitors in the past 84 days by 84.

784 / 84 = 9.3333

Since we cannot have a fraction of a visitor, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. In this case, it would be 9 visitors.

So, 9 visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9

After she visited a supermarket there were 49 dollars left. How much more money did she collect at the atm than she spent at the supermarket?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. Understand the given information:
   * Olivia initially had 3 dollars in her wallet.
   * She collected 49 more dollars from an ATM.
   * After visiting the supermarket, she had 49 dollars left.

2. Calculate the total amount Olivia had before going to the supermarket:

1. The waiter started with an unknown number of customers. Let's call this number x.

2. During the day, 9 customers left.

3. After these 9 customers left, the waiter still had 12 customers.

4. So, the number of customers at the start (x) minus the number of customers who left (9) equals the number of customers remaining (12).

We can write this as an equation:
   x - 9 = 12

To find the number of customers at the start, we need to solve for x:
   x - 9 = 12
   x - 9 + 9 = 12 + 9  (adding 9 to both sides)
   x = 21

Therefore, the waiter had 21 customers at the start. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",21

If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) Matthew has 28 friends, and he wants to give each friend an equal number of crackers and cakes.

2) He starts with 13 crackers and 15 cakes.

3) To find out how many crackers and cakes each person gets, we need to find the smallest number that divides both 13 and 15 evenly. This is because we want each person to get the same number of crackers and cakes, and we don't want to break any crackers or cakes.

4) The smallest number that divides both 13 and 15 is 1. 

   13 ÷ 1 = 13 (no remainder)
   15 ÷ 1 = 15 (no remainder)

5) So, each person will get 1 cracker and 1 cake.

6) But wait, there are 28 friends. Do we have enough crackers and cakes for everyone?

   1 cracker × 28 friends = 28 crackers needed
   1 cake × 28 friends = 28 cakes needed

   But Matthew only has 13 crackers and 15 cakes. That's not enough for everyone.

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) Dan bought 2 candy bars, and each candy bar costs the same amount. Let's call the cost of each candy bar 'x'.

2) Since Dan bought 2 candy bars, and each costs 'x', the total cost of the candy bars is 2x.

3) We are told that the total cost of the candy bars is $4. So we can write an equation:

   2x = 4

4) To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:

   2x/2 = 4/2
   x = 2

5) Therefore, each candy bar costs $2. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2

1. On Monday, Tiffany had 7 bags of cans.

2. The next day (Tuesday), she found 12 more bags of cans.

3. To find out how many more bags she found on Tuesday than she had on Monday, we need to subtract the number of bags she had on Monday from the number of bags she found on Tuesday.

   * More bags on Tuesday = Bags on Tuesday - Bags on Monday
   * More bags on Tuesday = 12 - 7
   * More bags on Tuesday = 5

Therefore, Tiffany found 5 more bags of cans on Tuesday than she had on Monday. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5

There, Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 246 visitors on that day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. Understand the given information:
   * On the previous day, 703 visitors came to the Buckingham Palace.
   * On the current day, there were 246 visitors.
   * We need to find the total number of visitors in 25 days.

2. Assume that the number of visitors remains the same each day. So, we can calculate the average number of visitors per day:
   * Average visitors per day = (703 + 246) ÷ 2
   * Average visitors per day = 949 ÷ 2
   * Average visitors per day = 474.5

3. Now, we can calculate the total number of visitors in 25 days:
   * Total visitors in 25 days = Average visitors per day × 25
   * Total visitors in 25 days = 474.5 × 25
   * Total visitors in 25 days = 11,862.5

Since we can't have half a person visiting, we round down the result to 11,862.

Therefore, approximately 11,862 people visited the Buckingham Palace within 25 days. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",11862

If the bananas are organized into 47 groups and oranges are organized into 178 groups How big is each group of oranges?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 142 bananas in total.
   * There are 356 oranges in total.
   * The bananas are organized into 47 groups.
   * The oranges are organized into 178 groups.

2. We need to find out how many oranges are in each group.

3. To find the number of oranges in each group, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of groups.

4. Total number of oranges = 356
   Number of orange groups = 178

5. Number of oranges in each group = Total number of oranges ÷ Number of orange groups
                                   = 356 ÷ 178

If you read 19 of the movies and watched 16 of the books How many more movies than books have you read?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) First, let's understand what the question is asking. It's asking how many more movies you have read compared to the number of books you have watched.

2) Now, let's look at the given information:
   - There are 8 different books in the series.
   - There are 5 different movies in the series.
   - You read 19 of the movies.
   - You watched 16 of the books.

3) But wait, something seems odd here. How can you read 19 movies when there are only 5 different movies in the series? Similarly, how can you watch 16 books when there are only 8 different books?

4) It seems like the question has mixed up the terms ""read"" and ""watched"". Let's assume that you meant to say you watched 19 movies and read 16 books.

5) Now, to find how many more movies you watched than books you read, we need to subtract:

   Movies watched - Books read = 19 - 16 = 3

Therefore, you watched 3 more movies than the number of books you read. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3

   * 2 more birds came to join them.

2. Now, let's calculate the total number of birds after the 2 new birds joined:
   * Total birds = Initial birds + New birds
   * Total birds = 3 + 2 = 5 birds

3. The number of storks remains the same:
   * Total storks = 4 storks

4. To find how many more birds than storks are on the fence, we subtract the number of storks from the number of birds:

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. The grasshopper jumped 9 inches.

2. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper. So, let's find out how far the frog jumped:
   * Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump + 33 inches
   * Frog's jump = 9 inches + 33 inches
   * Frog's jump = 42 inches

3. The mouse jumped 3 inches lesser than the frog. So, let's find out how far the mouse jumped:
   * Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 3 inches

She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. First, let's find out how many cards Nell had in total initially:
   * Baseball cards: 309
   * Ace cards: 356
   * Total cards initially = 309 + 356 = 665

2. After giving some cards to Jeff, Nell now has 415 cards in total.

3. To find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff:
   * Cards given to Jeff = Total cards initially - Remaining cards
   * Cards given to Jeff = 665 - 415 = 250

4. Now, we don't know how many baseball cards or Ace cards Nell gave to Jeff. But we know that the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards remains the same.

5. Initially, the difference was:
   * Initial difference = Baseball cards - Ace cards
   * Initial difference = 309 - 356 = -47 (negative means she had 47 more Ace cards)

6. After giving cards to Jeff, the difference remains the same, -47.

7. Let's say Nell now has 'x' baseball cards. Then she would have (415 - x) Ace cards, because the total is 415.

8. We can write an equation:
   * x - (415 - x) = -47
   * x - 415 + x = -47
   * 2x - 415 = -47
   * 2x = -47 + 415
   * 2x = 368
   * x = 368 / 2 = 184

9. So, Nell now has 184 baseball cards and (415 - 184) = 231 Ace cards.

10. The difference is:
    * Difference = Ace cards - Baseball cards
    * Difference = 231 - 184 = 47

Therefore, Nell has 47 more Ace cards than baseball cards. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",47

After some left he still had 14 customers. Then he got 10 new customers How many customers does he have now?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. Initially, the waiter had 12 customers.

2. After some customers left, he still had 14 customers. This means that the number of customers increased. We don't need to know how many left or joined at this point, just that the number of customers is now 14.

3. Then, 10 new customers arrived.

4. To find the total number of customers now, we add the number of customers he had after step 2 (which is 14) and the number of new customers who arrived (which is 10).

   14 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the waiter now has 24 customers. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",24

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. The farmer had 90 tomatoes in his garden.

2. Yesterday, he picked 154 of the tomatoes. But this doesn't make sense because 154 is more than 90. It seems there's an error in the question.

3. Today, he picked 50 tomatoes.

4. To find the total number of tomatoes he picked, we should add the number of tomatoes he picked yesterday and today.

   But since the number of tomatoes he picked yesterday is incorrect, we can't solve this problem as it is.

If we assume that the question meant to say he picked 54 tomatoes yesterday (instead of 154), then the solution would be:

   54 (picked yesterday) + 50 (picked today) = 104 tomatoes in total.

However, with the given information, the question cannot be answered correctly due to the inconsistency in the data provided. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",: The question cannot be answered due to an error in the given information.

claude-3-opus-20240229,Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar How many cups of flour did she put in?,2.0,sbs,"Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar How many cups of flour did she put in?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) Let's define some variables:
   - Let $f$ be the number of cups of flour Mary has already put in.
   - Let $s$ be the number of cups of sugar Mary needs.

2) We know from the recipe that in total:
   - Mary needs 11 cups of flour
   - Mary needs 7 cups of sugar

3) We also know that Mary needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar. We can express this as an equation:
   
   $f + 2 = s$

4) But we also know that the total amount of flour needed is 11 cups. So the amount of flour Mary has already put in ($f$) plus the amount of sugar she needs ($s$) must equal 11:

   $f + s = 11$

5) Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

   $f + 2 = s$
   $f + s = 11$

6) We can solve this by substituting the first equation into the second:

   $f + (f + 2) = 11$

7) Simplify:

   $2f + 2 = 11$

8) Subtract 2 from both sides:

   $2f = 9$

9) Divide both sides by 2:

   $f = 4.5$

Therefore, Mary has already put in 4.5 cups of flour. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is", 4.5.

How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?,24.0,sbs,"Q: 36 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 68 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 12 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) First, let's understand what we know:
   - Initially, there were 36 children on the bus.
   - At the bus stop, 68 children got off the bus.
   - Some more children got on the bus.
   - After this, there were 12 children on the bus.

2) Let's say the number of children who got on the bus is x.

3) After 68 children got off and x children got on, there were 12 children on the bus. We can write this as an equation:
   
   36 - 68 + x = 12

4) Let's solve this equation for x:
   
   36 - 68 + x = 12
   -32 + x = 12
   x = 12 + 32
   x = 44

5) So, 44 children got on the bus.

6) The question asks how many more children got off the bus than those that got on. We can find this by subtracting:

   68 - 44 = 24

Therefore, 24 more children got off the bus than those that got on. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",24

He ate 14 cookies and gave 13 of them to his friend. How many more cookies did he eat than those he gave to his friend?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) First, let's identify the important information in the question:
   - Paco had 17 cookies in total.
   - He ate 14 cookies.
   - He gave 13 cookies to his friend.

2) Now, let's think about this logically. If Paco had 17 cookies in total, and he gave 13 to his friend, that means he couldn't have eaten 14 cookies. The total number of cookies he ate and gave away can't be more than the total number of cookies he had to start with.

3) So, there seems to be an error in the question. It's not possible for Paco to eat 14 cookies and give 13 to his friend if he only had 17 cookies to start with.

4) If we assume that the number of cookies he ate is correct (14), then he could have only given 3 cookies to his friend (because 14 + 3 = 17).

5) In this case, the number of cookies he ate (14) minus the number of cookies he gave to his friend (3) would be 11.

However, since the question itself has inconsistent information, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer. The question would need to be clarified or corrected before it can be answered accurately. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",":

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) First, let's find out how far the frog jumped. We know the frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper. So:
   
   Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump + 10 inches
               = 19 inches + 10 inches
               = 29 inches

2) Now, let's find out how far the mouse jumped. We know the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog. So:

                = 29 inches + 20 inches
                = 49 inches

3) Now, to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump:

   * Marco and his dad picked strawberries together.
   * The total weight of their strawberries is 4 pounds.
   * Marco's strawberries weigh 19 pounds.

2. Find the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries:
   * Total weight = Marco's weight + Dad's weight
   * Dad's weight = Total weight - Marco's weight
   * Dad's weight = 4 pounds - 19 pounds
   * Dad's weight = -15 pounds

3. However, weight cannot be negative. So, there seems to be an error in the question. It's not possible for the total weight to be less than Marco's weight alone.

4. Assuming the total weight should be 24 pounds (Marco's weight + Dad's weight), let's find the difference:
   * Difference = Marco's weight - Dad's weight
   * Difference = 19 pounds - (24 pounds - 19 pounds)
   * Difference = 19 pounds - 5 pounds
   * Difference = 14 pounds

So, if we assume the total weight is 24 pounds, then Marco's strawberries weigh 14 pounds more than his dad's. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is", 14 pounds.

   Monday's kids - Wednesday's kids = 6 - 4 = 2

Therefore, Julia played with 2 more kids on Monday than on Wednesday. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2
claude-3-opus-20240229,Carol was sending out birthday invitations to 10 friends. If each package of invitations she bought had 2 invitations in it How many packs does she need so that no friend gets left out?,5.0,sbs,"Q: Carol was sending out birthday invitations to 10 friends. If each package of invitations she bought had 2 invitations in it How many packs does she need so that no friend gets left out?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. Carol wants to send invitations to 10 friends.
2. Each package of invitations contains 2 invitations.
3. We need to find out how many packs Carol needs to buy so that every friend gets an invitation.

To solve this, we can divide the total number of friends by the number of invitations in each pack. However, we need to make sure we have enough packs to cover all friends, even if there's a remainder.

4. Number of packs needed = Total friends ÷ Invitations per pack
   * 10 ÷ 2 = 5

But 5 packs would only cover exactly 10 friends. If there's any remainder, Carol would need an additional pack to ensure no friend is left out.

5. In this case, 10 is divisible by 2 with no remainder. So, Carol needs exactly 5 packs.

Therefore, Carol needs to buy 5 packs of invitations to ensure all her 10 friends receive an invitation. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5

   * Frog's jump = 51 inches

3. Calculate how far the mouse jumped:
   * Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 16 inches
   * Mouse's jump = 51 inches - 16 inches
   * Mouse's jump = 35 inches

4. Calculate how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper:
   * Difference = Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump

   * Bird families that stayed behind = 45 - 86 = -41

   However, the number of bird families can't be negative. This means that the question has an error or inconsistency. Let's assume that all 45 bird families flew away, and none stayed behind.

4. Find how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind:
   * Bird families that flew away = 45
   * Bird families that stayed behind = 0
   * Difference = Bird families that flew away - Bird families that stayed behind
   * Difference = 45 - 0 = 45

So, assuming all 45 bird families flew away, 45 more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",45

How many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence?,3.0,sbs,"Q: 2 birds were sitting on the fence. 5 more birds and 4 more storks came to join them. How many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. Initially, there were 2 birds on the fence.
   * Number of birds at the start = 2
   * Number of storks at the start = 0

2. Then, 5 more birds came to join them.
   * Number of birds now = Initial birds + Joined birds
   * Number of birds now = 2 + 5 = 7
   * Number of storks now = 0

3. After that, 4 storks also came to join them.

He gave 30 cookies to his friend and ate 23 cookies. How many more cookies did he give to his friend than those he ate?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. Paco had 6 cookies to start with.
2. He gave 30 cookies to his friend.
3. He ate 23 cookies.

Now, let's think about this logically. If Paco started with only 6 cookies, he couldn't have given away 30 cookies and also eaten 23 cookies. The total of cookies given away and eaten (30 + 23 = 53) is much more than the number of cookies he started with (6).

So, there seems to be an error in the question. The given information doesn't make sense.

If we assume the question meant to ask ""How many more cookies did he give to his friend than those he had at the start?"", then the answer would be:

* Cookies given to friend = 30
* Cookies at the start = 6
* 30 - 6 = 24

So, he gave 24 more cookies to his friend than he had at the start.

But as the question is currently phrased, it cannot be answered due to the inconsistency in the given information. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",: The question cannot be answered due to inconsistent information.

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. We know that there are 17 pizzas, and each pizza has 4 slices.

2. To find the total number of slices, we need to multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza.

   Total slices = Number of pizzas × Slices per pizza
                = 17 × 4
                = 68

3. So, there are 68 slices of pizza altogether.

4. The number of people (25) is not relevant to the question of how many slices there are in total. However, if you wanted to know how many slices each person would get if the pizzas were divided equally, you could divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

   Slices per person = Total slices ÷ Number of people
                     = 68 ÷ 25
                     = 2 remainder 18
                     
   This means each person would get 2 slices, and there would be 18 slices left over. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is", 68 slices.

To find the total number of bananas, we need to multiply the number of groups by the number of bananas in each group.

Total bananas = Number of groups × Bananas per group
               = 140 × 187
               = 26,180

Therefore, Philip has 26,180 bananas in his collection. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",26180
claude-3-opus-20240229,Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 6. Rebecca has 18 eggs 72 bananas and 66 marbles. How many groups will be created?,3.0,sbs,"Q: Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 6. Rebecca has 18 eggs 72 bananas and 66 marbles. How many groups will be created?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. We need to focus on the eggs because Rebecca wants to split the eggs into groups. The number of bananas and marbles is irrelevant to the question.

2. Rebecca has 18 eggs in total.

3. She wants to split these eggs into groups of 6.

4. To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs in each group.

   Number of groups = Total eggs ÷ Eggs per group
                    = 18 ÷ 6
                    = 3

Therefore, Rebecca can create 3 groups of 6 eggs each. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3
claude-3-opus-20240229,Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?,211.0,sbs,"Q: Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms.

2) In the first week of jogging, she lost 62 kilograms.

3) In the second week of jogging, she lost 140 kilograms.

4) To find her weight before starting to jog, we need to add the weight she lost to her current weight.

   Weight before jogging = Current weight + Weight lost in first week + Weight lost in second week
                         = 9 kg + 62 kg + 140 kg
                         = 211 kg

However, there seems to be an error in the question. It's highly unlikely for a person to weigh 9 kilograms (which is about 20 pounds, a normal weight for a 6-month-old baby), and even more unlikely to lose 62 kg and 140 kg in two weeks. The average adult human weighs around 50-90 kg. Losing that much weight in such a short time is not possible or healthy.

I suspect the question meant to use different units or numbers. If you encountered this question elsewhere, I recommend checking if it's stated correctly. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is"," 211 kg, but the question itself seems to have unrealistic data."

How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) First, let's find out how many peaches Jill has. We know that Steven has 4 peaches and he has 11 more than Jill. So, if we subtract 11 from Steven's peaches, we'll get Jill's peaches.

   Jill's peaches = Steven's peaches - 11
                  = 4 - 11
                  = -7

   But wait, can Jill have negative peaches? No, that doesn't make sense. So, let's rethink this.

2) If Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill, and Steven has 4 peaches, then:

   Steven's peaches = Jill's peaches + 11
   4 = Jill's peaches + 11

   Now, we can solve for Jill's peaches:

   Jill's peaches = 4 - 11
                  = -7

   So, Jill has -7 peaches.

3) Now, let's find out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. So, we can subtract 12 from Steven's peaches to get Jake's peaches.

   Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 12
                  = 4 - 12
                  = -8

4) Now, to find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake, we can subtract Jake's peaches from Jill's peaches.

   Difference = Jill's peaches - Jake's peaches
              = -7 - (-8)
              = -7 + 8
              = 1

Therefore, Jill has 1 more peach than Jake. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",1

How many chapters did he read per day?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. Understand the given information:
   * The book has 2 chapters.
   * Each chapter has 405 pages.
   * It took Frank 664 days to finish the book.

2. Calculate the total number of pages in the book:
   * Pages per chapter = 405
   * Number of chapters = 2
   * Total pages = Pages per chapter × Number of chapters
   * Total pages = 405 × 2 = 810 pages

3. Calculate the number of pages Frank read per day:
   * Total days to finish the book = 664
   * Pages read per day = Total pages ÷ Total days
   * Pages read per day = 810 ÷ 664 ≈ 1.22 pages per day

4. Since each chapter has 405 pages, and Frank read about 1.22 pages per day, we can calculate how many days it took him to read one chapter:
   * Days to read one chapter = Pages per chapter ÷ Pages read per day
   * Days to read one chapter = 405 ÷ 1.22 ≈ 332 days

5. Now, we can calculate how many chapters Frank read per day:
   * Chapters read per day = 1 chapter ÷ Days to read one chapter
   * Chapters read per day = 1 ÷ 332 ≈ 0.003 chapters per day

Therefore, Frank read approximately 0.003 chapters per day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is", 0.003.

claude-3-opus-20240229,Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven and 18 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 16 peaches. How many more peaches does Steven have than Jill?,27.0,sbs,"Q: Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven and 18 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 16 peaches. How many more peaches does Steven have than Jill?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) First, let's find out how many peaches Jake has. We know that:
   - Steven has 16 peaches.
   - Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven.

   So, Jake has 16 - 9 = 7 peaches.

2) Now, let's find out how many peaches Jill has. We know that:
   - Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill.
   - Jake has 7 peaches (from step 1).

   So, if Jake has 18 more than Jill, then Jill has 18 less than Jake.
   Jill's peaches = 7 - 18 = -11

   But wait, it's not possible to have negative peaches! This means that the question doesn't make sense with the given information. There's an inconsistency in the data provided.

3) However, if we assume the question meant to say ""Jill has 18 fewer peaches than Jake"" (instead of Jake having 18 more than Jill), then we can solve it:

   Jill's peaches = Jake's peaches - 18
                  = 7 - 18 = -11

4) Now, to find how many more peaches Steven has than Jill:
   Difference = Steven's peaches - Jill's peaches
              = 16 - (-11)
              = 16 + 11
              = 27

Therefore, with the assumption in step 3, Steven has 27 more peaches than Jill. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",27

Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 17 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she cut than those she threw away?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) First, let's understand what the question is asking. We need to find out how many new roses Jessica cut from her garden.

2) We know that initially there were 15 roses in the vase.

3) Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase. But wait, this doesn't make sense because there were only 15 roses in the vase to start with. She can't throw away more roses than she had.

4) Let's assume this was a mistake in the question and Jessica actually threw away 3 roses (not 33).

5) After throwing away 3 roses, there would be 12 roses left in the vase (15 - 3 = 12).

6) Now, there are 17 roses in the vase. So, the number of new roses she cut and put in the vase must be the difference between 17 and 12.

7) The number of new roses = 17 - 12 = 5

8) So, Jessica cut 5 new roses from her garden.

9) The question also asks how many more roses she cut than those she threw away. She threw away 3 roses and cut 5 new roses.

10) The difference is 5 - 3 = 2

Therefore, Jessica cut 2 more roses than those she threw away. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) Let's say Doug had 'x' marbles initially.

2) Then, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, which means Ed had 'x + 2' marbles.

3) After Doug lost some marbles, let's say he now has 'y' marbles.

4) We know that Ed now has 19 more marbles than Doug. This means:
   
   x + 2 = y + 19

5) We also know that the number of marbles Doug lost is the difference between the number of marbles he had initially and the number he has now. In other words, the marbles Doug lost = x - y.

6) From the equation in step 4, we can get:
   
   x = y + 17

7) Substituting this value of x in the expression from step 5:
   
   Marbles Doug lost = x - y
                     = (y + 17) - y
                     = 17

She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar How many cups of flour did she put in?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) The recipe needs:
   - 3 cups of sugar
   - 10 cups of flour

2) Mary has already put in some cups of flour. Let's call this number $x$.

3) She still needs to add 5 more cups of flour than sugar. This means:
   
   Remaining flour to add = Remaining sugar to add + 5

4) Now, let's calculate the remaining sugar and flour:
   - Remaining sugar = Total sugar needed - Sugar added
                     = 3 - 0 (since no sugar is added yet)
                     = 3 cups

   - Remaining flour = Total flour needed - Flour added
                     = 10 - $x$ cups

5) Using the equation from step 3:
   
   10 - $x$ = 3 + 5
   
   10 - $x$ = 8

6) Solving for $x$:
   
   $x$ = 10 - 8 = 2

Therefore, Mary has already put in 2 cups of flour. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) Initially, Bobby had 20 pieces of candy.

2) Then, it says he ate 34 pieces of candy. But this doesn't make sense because he only had 20 pieces to start with. He can't eat more candy than he has.

3) After that, it says he ate 18 more pieces. Again, this is not possible because he didn't have any candy left after eating the first 34 pieces (which was already more than he had).

4) So, the question doesn't provide a logically consistent scenario. It's not possible to determine how many pieces of candy Bobby ate because the given information is contradictory.

In problems like these, it's important to identify when the given information doesn't make sense or is insufficient to answer the question. In this case, the question itself is flawed. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",":

   * Estimated visitors in 245 days = 648 × 245 = 158,760 visitors

4. Compare the number of visitors on the day they visited with the estimated number of visitors in the previous 245 days:
   * Difference = 705 - 158,760 = -158,055

So, there were 158,055 fewer visitors on the day they visited compared to the estimated number of visitors in the previous 245 days.

Please note that this is an estimation based on the assumption that the previous two days represent the average number of visitors per day over the past 245 days. The actual number might be different. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","-158,055.00"

How much did she weigh before starting to jog?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms.

2) After she started jogging, she lost 101 kilograms.

3) But wait, something doesn't seem right. If Jessie lost 101 kilograms, and now weighs 27 kilograms, that would mean she weighed 128 kilograms before she started jogging.

4) 128 kilograms is an extremely high weight for a person, especially someone who is able to jog. It's more likely that the question meant to say she lost 10 kilograms, not 101.

5) So, assuming the question meant to say 10 kilograms, let's solve it:
   - Current weight = 27 kg
   - Weight lost = 10 kg
   - Weight before jogging = Current weight + Weight lost
   - Weight before jogging = 27 kg + 10 kg = 37 kg

Therefore, assuming the question meant to say Jessie lost 10 kilograms, she weighed 37 kilograms before she started jogging. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",37

He bought a chocolate for $ 3 and a candy bar for $ 7. How much money did he spend to buy candy bar than he did to buy chocolate?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. Understand the given information:
   * Dan has $5.
   * The chocolate costs $3.
   * The candy bar costs $7.

2. Find the difference between the cost of the candy bar and the chocolate:
   * Difference = Cost of candy bar - Cost of chocolate
   * Difference = $7 - $3
   * Difference = $4

So, Dan spent $4 more to buy the candy bar than he did to buy the chocolate.

However, there's an issue with the question. Dan only has $5, but the candy bar alone costs $7. This means he doesn't have enough money to buy both the chocolate and the candy bar. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is"," $4, but the question itself has an inconsistency."
claude-3-opus-20240229,Jessie weighed 92 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 56 kilograms in the first week and 99 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh after the first week of jogging?,36.0,sbs,"Q: Jessie weighed 92 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 56 kilograms in the first week and 99 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh after the first week of jogging?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jessie initially weighed 92 kilograms.
   * In the first week of jogging, she lost 56 kilograms.
   * In the second week of jogging, she lost 99 kilograms.

2. Calculate Jessie's weight after the first week of jogging:
   * Weight after first week = Initial weight - Weight lost in first week
   * Weight after first week = 92 kilograms - 56 kilograms
   * Weight after first week = 36 kilograms

However, there seems to be an issue with the given information. It's highly unlikely for a person to lose 56 kilograms in a week, and even more improbable to lose 99 kilograms in the following week. These numbers are unrealistic for weight loss in such a short period.

Assuming the question meant to say ""pounds"" instead of ""kilograms,"" let's recalculate:

1. Convert initial weight to pounds:
   * 92 kilograms ≈ 202.8 pounds

2. Calculate Jessie's weight after the first week of jogging:
   * Weight after first week = Initial weight - Weight lost in first week
   * Weight after first week = 202.8 pounds - 56 pounds
   * Weight after first week = 146.8 pounds

Therefore, if we assume the question meant to use pounds, Jessie would weigh approximately 146.8 pounds after the first week of jogging. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is", 146.8 pounds.

Then there were 16 children altogether on the bus. How many children got on the bus at the bus stop?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. First, let's understand what we know:
   * Initially, there were 21 children on the bus.
   * At the bus stop, 10 children got off the bus.
   * After the bus stop, there were 16 children on the bus.

2. Now, let's find out how many children were on the bus after 10 children got off:
   * Children on the bus after some got off = Initial number of children - Children who got off
   * Children on the bus after some got off = 21 - 10 = 11

3. We know that after the bus stop, there were 16 children on the bus. So, let's find out how many children got on at the bus stop:
   * Let the number of children who got on at the bus stop be x.
   * Total children on the bus after the stop = Children on the bus after some got off + Children who got on
   * 16 = 11 + x

4. Now, we can solve the equation to find x:

5. We know that the total number of invitations is 12 (because Carol is inviting 12 friends).

So, we can write an equation:
   3x = 12

6. To find 'x', we divide both sides by 3:
   x = 12 ÷ 3
   x = 4

Therefore, each pack contains 4 invitations. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4

He bought a candy bar for $ 6 and a chocolate for $ 3. How much money did he spend to buy candy bar than he did to buy chocolate?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) First, let's identify the important information from the question:
   - Dan has $2.
   - The candy bar costs $6.
   - The chocolate costs $3.

2) Now, let's calculate how much more Dan spent on the candy bar compared to the chocolate.
   - Money spent on candy bar = $6
   - Money spent on chocolate = $3

How many apples does Bob have?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) Let's say Jackie has x apples. Then, Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, which means Adam has x + 4 apples.

2) Together, Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. We can write this as an equation:
   
   x + (x + 4) = 14

3) Simplify the equation:
   
   2x + 4 = 14

4) Subtract 4 from both sides:
   
   2x = 10

5) Divide both sides by 2:
   
   x = 5

   So, Jackie has 5 apples and Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.

She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar How many more cups of flour does she need to add?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) The recipe needs:
   - 6 cups of flour
   - 13 cups of sugar

2) Mary has already put in some cups of flour. Let's call this number x.

3) She needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. This means:
   - Remaining flour = Remaining sugar + 8

4) Remaining sugar:
   - Total sugar needed - Sugar already added
   - Sugar is not added yet, so sugar already added = 0
   - Remaining sugar = 13 - 0 = 13 cups

5) Remaining flour:
   - Remaining flour = Remaining sugar + 8
   - Remaining flour = 13 + 8 = 21 cups

6) Flour already added (x):
   - Total flour needed = Flour already added + Remaining flour
   - 6 = x + 21
   - x = 6 - 21 = -15

7) But x can't be negative as Mary can't add negative cups of flour. So, we assume she hasn't added any flour yet.

Therefore, Mary needs to add all 6 cups of flour. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. First, let's identify the important information:
   * Edward spent $9.
   * Then he spent $8 more.
   * Now he has $17.

2. We need to find out how much money Edward had before he spent any money. Let's call this amount 'x'.

3. After spending $9, Edward would have had 'x - 9' dollars.

4. Then, he spent $8 more. So after this second spending, he would have had '(x - 9) - 8' dollars.

5. We know that after all his spending, he now has $17. So we can write an equation:
   * (x - 9) - 8 = 17

6. Let's solve this equation for x:
   * (x - 9) - 8 = 17
   * x - 9 - 8 = 17
   * x - 17 = 17

How many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. We know that David did 51 push-ups.
2. We also know that David did 49 more push-ups than Zachary.
3. To find how many push-ups Zachary did, we need to subtract 49 from David's push-ups:
   * Zachary's push-ups = David's push-ups - 49
   * Zachary's push-ups = 51 - 49 = 2

4. Now we know that:
   * David did 51 push-ups
   * Zachary did 2 push-ups

5. To find the total number of push-ups they did altogether, we add their individual push-ups:
   * Total push-ups = David's push-ups + Zachary's push-ups
   * Total push-ups = 51 + 2 = 53

If her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide How much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) First, let's find the total area of Jesse's room. We know that the area of a rectangle is given by length times width. 

   Area of the room = Length × Width
                    = 4 feet × 20 feet
                    = 80 square feet

2) Now, we know that Jesse already has 18 square feet of carpet. To find out how much more carpet she needs, we need to subtract the carpet she has from the total area of the room.

   Additional carpet needed = Total area of the room - Carpet she has
                            = 80 square feet - 18 square feet
                            = 62 square feet

The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches.

2. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog. So, to find how far the frog jumped, we need to subtract 25 from the grasshopper's jump:
   * Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - 25 inches
   * Frog's jump = 21 inches - 25 inches = -4 inches
   * But a jump can't be negative, so this means the frog jumped 4 inches.

3. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. So, to find how far the mouse jumped, we need to subtract 16 from the frog's jump:
   * Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 16 inches
   * Mouse's jump = 4 inches - 16 inches = -12 inches
   * Again, a jump can't be negative, so this means the mouse actually jumped 12 inches less than the grasshopper.

4. To find how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse, we need to subtract the mouse's jump from the grasshopper's jump:
   * Difference = Grasshopper's jump - Mouse's jump
   * Difference = 21 inches - (21 inches - 12 inches)

2. We also know that 829 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days. This includes the visitors from the previous day and the current day.

3. To find out how many visitors came on the current day, we need to subtract the number of visitors from the previous 84 days from the total number of visitors in the past 85 days.

4. But we don't know the number of visitors from the previous 84 days. However, we can assume that the number of visitors was the same each day. This way, we can calculate the average number of visitors per day.

5. Average number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors ÷ Number of days
   * Average number of visitors per day = 829 ÷ 85 = 9.75294...

6. Now, we can calculate the number of visitors for the previous 84 days:
   * Visitors in the previous 84 days = Average number of visitors per day × 84
   * Visitors in the previous 84 days = 9.75294... × 84 = 819.2470...

7. Finally, we can find the number of visitors on the current day by subtracting the visitors from the previous 84 days from the total visitors:
   * Visitors on the current day = Total visitors - Visitors in the previous 84 days
   * Visitors on the current day = 829 - 819.2470... = 9.7529...

Since we can't have a fractional number of visitors, we round this up to 10.

Therefore, 10 visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10

claude-3-opus-20240229,There are 2 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 4 red peaches and some more green peaches. If there are a total of 12 peaches in all baskets How many green peaches are in each basket?,2.0,sbs,"Q: There are 2 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 4 red peaches and some more green peaches. If there are a total of 12 peaches in all baskets How many green peaches are in each basket?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1) We know there are 2 baskets in total.

2) Each basket has 4 red peaches.

3) So, the total number of red peaches is:
   
   4 red peaches per basket × 2 baskets = 8 red peaches in total

4) We also know that there are 12 peaches in total (red and green combined).

5) To find the number of green peaches, we can subtract the number of red peaches from the total number of peaches:
   
   12 peaches in total - 8 red peaches = 4 green peaches

6) Since the question states that each basket has the same number of green peaches, we can divide the total number of green peaches by the number of baskets:
   
   4 green peaches ÷ 2 baskets = 2 green peaches per basket

Therefore, each basket has 2 green peaches. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2

   * Total junk mail = 78 × 38
   * Total junk mail = 2,964 pieces

3. Calculate the number of junk mail pieces each house should receive:
   * Junk mail per house = Junk mail per block ÷ Number of houses per block
   * Junk mail per house = 38 ÷ 19
   * Junk mail per house = 2 pieces

Therefore, the mailman should give each house 2 pieces of junk mail. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2

How many ripe apples did the tree have to begin with?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. Understand the given information:
   * Rachel picked 3 ripe apples from her tree.
   * After picking, the tree has 2 ripe apples and 27 unripe apples.
   * We need to find out how many ripe apples the tree had initially.

2. Let's call the initial number of ripe apples on the tree 'x'.

3. After Rachel picked 3 ripe apples, the number of ripe apples left on the tree is x - 3.

4. We know that after picking, the tree has 2 ripe apples left. So, we can write an equation:
   * x - 3 = 2

5. To find the initial number of ripe apples (x), we add 3 to both sides of the equation:
   * x - 3 + 3 = 2 + 3
   * x = 5

Therefore, the tree had 5 ripe apples to begin with. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5

   * She also got 82 bonus points in each game.
   * We need to find her total points in 79 games.

2. Calculate the total points Melissa scored in one game:
   * Total points per game = Regular points + Bonus points
   * Total points per game = 109 + 82
   * Total points per game = 191

3. Calculate the total points Melissa scored in 79 games:
   * Total points in 79 games = Total points per game × Number of games
   * Total points in 79 games = 191 × 79
   * Total points in 79 games = 15,089

Therefore, Melissa scored a total of 15,089 points in 79 games. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",15089

He needs a total of 57 g of colors to paint them. He needs 22 g of wax more. If the feathers require a total of 353 g of wax How many grams of wax does he already have?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. Understand the given information:
   * He needs 57 g of colors to paint the feathers.
   * He needs 22 g of wax more than the colors.
   * The feathers require a total of 353 g of wax.

2. Calculate the total amount of wax he needs:
   * Wax needed = Colors needed + 22 g
   * Wax needed = 57 g + 22 g
   * Wax needed = 79 g

3. Now we know the total wax needed is 353 g, and the additional wax he needs is 79 g. To find out how much wax he already has, we need to subtract the additional wax needed from the total wax required:
   * Wax he already has = Total wax required - Additional wax needed
   * Wax he already has = 353 g - 79 g
   * Wax he already has = 274 g

Therefore, he already has 274 grams of wax. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",274

They put 15 seeds in each flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flowers did they grow?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. Understand the given information:
   * Paige and her mom planted 55 seeds in total.
   * They put 15 seeds in each flower bed.
   * Only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. (This seems to be an error in the question, as it contradicts the previous information. Let's assume that 60% of the seeds in each flower bed grew into flowers.)

2. Find the number of flower beds they planted:
   * Total seeds = 55
   * Seeds per flower bed = 15
   * Number of flower beds = Total seeds ÷ Seeds per flower bed
   * Number of flower beds = 55 ÷ 15 = 3 remainder 10 (They planted in 3 full flower beds and had 10 seeds left over)

3. Calculate the number of flowers in each full flower bed:
   * Seeds per flower bed = 15
   * Percentage of seeds that grew into flowers = 60% or 0.6
   * Flowers per bed = Seeds per flower bed × Percentage of seeds that grew
   * Flowers per bed = 15 × 0.6 = 9

4. Calculate the number of flowers in the last flower bed:
   * Remaining seeds = 10
   * Flowers in the last bed = Remaining seeds × Percentage of seeds that grew
   * Flowers in the last bed = 10 × 0.6 = 6

5. Sum up the total number of flowers:
   * Total flowers = (Flowers per bed × Number of full flower beds) + Flowers in the last bed
   * Total flowers = (9 × 3) + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33

Therefore, Paige and her mom grew a total of 33 flowers. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",33

How far did the frog jump?

A: Let's think step by step. 

1. The grasshopper jumped 13 inches.

2. The question states that ""The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper."" This doesn't make sense because the grasshopper can't jump farther than itself. 

   I think what you meant was ""The frog jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper.""

3. So, if the frog jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper, we can find the frog's jump distance by adding 2 inches to the grasshopper's jump distance.

4. Grasshopper's jump distance + 2 inches = Frog's jump distance
   13 inches + 2 inches = 15 inches

Therefore, the frog jumped 15 inches. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",15

If you read 19 of the movies and watched 16 of the books How many more movies than books have you read?

A: Let's think step by step.  

You can't read movies or watch books, so I think there might be a mistake in the question. Let's assume it meant to say ""If you read 16 of the books and watched 19 of the movies"".

If there are 8 different books and you read 16, that doesn't make sense because you can't read more books than exist. Let's assume it meant to say you read 6 of the books (since 8 - 6 = 2, so you haven't read 2 of them).

If there are 5 different movies and you watched 19, that doesn't make sense because you can't watch more movies than exist. Let's assume it meant to say you watched 4 of the movies (since 5 - 4 = 1, so you haven't watched 1 of them).

Now, let's answer the question. You've read 6 books and watched 4 movies. So, you've watched 4 - 6 = -2 more movies than books. Wait, that's negative! That means you've read 2 more books than you've watched movies. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",: 2

A: Let's think step by step.  The farmer had 90 tomatoes in his garden. But he picked 154 tomatoes yesterday, which is more than he had in his garden! So, he must have picked some tomatoes that weren't his. Let's ignore that for now.

He picked 154 tomatoes yesterday and 50 today. To find the total number of tomatoes he picked, we can add these two numbers together:

154 + 50 = 204

A: Let's think step by step.  Jackie has some apples. Adam has 4 more than Jackie. So if Jackie has x apples, Adam has x + 4 apples. Together they have 14 apples. So x + (x + 4) = 14. x + x + 4 = 14. 2x + 4 = 14. 2x = 10. x = 5. So Jackie has 5 apples and Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples. Together they have 5 + 9 = 14 apples. Bob has 6 more than 14. So Bob has 14 + 6 = 20 apples. The answer is 20. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",: 20
