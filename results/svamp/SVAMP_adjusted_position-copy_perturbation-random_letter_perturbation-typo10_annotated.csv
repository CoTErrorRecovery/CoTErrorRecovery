15. So Jake has 7 peaches and Jill has 7 - 18 = -11 peaches. This still doesn't make sense, so we made another mistake.
16. Let's check the problem again. We are told that Steven has 16 peaches, but we are also told that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven. This means that Jake has 16 - 9 = 7 peaches, not Steven.
17. We can use the equation J = S - 9 to find that Steven has S = J + 9 peaches.
18. We know that Jake has 7 peaches, so Steven has S = 7 + 9 = 16 peaches.
19. We also know that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, so we can write another equation: J = J + 18, where J is the number of peaches Jill has.
20. Solving for J, we get J = -18. This means that Jill has -18 peaches, which doesn't make sense.
21. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem that makes sense. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",N/A.,,,,

Danny had some old bottle caps in his collection. He threw away 54 of them at the park. While he was at the park, he found 48 new bottle caps and added them to his collection. Now he has a total of 52 bottle caps in his collection. 

To find out how many more bottle caps Danny threw away than those he found at the park, we need to subtract the number of new bottle caps from the number of old bottle caps he threw away.

2. Soe drank 15 paied bottles a day, sq the water bottles wfuld last for 179 days. 

Explanation: 

To find out how many days the water bottles would last, we need to divide the total number of water bottles by the number of water bottles Debby drinks per day. 

Total number of water bottles = 180 

Number of water bottles Debby drinks per day = 15 

180 ÷ 15 = 12 

So, the water bottles would last for 12 days. 

Now, let's find out how many days the soda bottles would last. 

Total number of soda bottles = 95 

Number of soda bottles Debby drinks per day = 54 

95 ÷ 54 = 1.76

5. We need to find out how many crayons he got for his birthday.

To solve this problem, we can use subtraction. We know thaf Paul had some crayons before his birthday, and then he got a box of crayons for his birthday. So, the total number of crayons he had at the beginning of the school year is:

Total number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday

We don't know how many crayons Paul had before his birthday, but we can use the information we have to find out. We know that he lost or gave away 315 crayons, so we can write:

Total number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315

We also know that by the end of the school year, Paul had 291 crayons left. So we can wrlte:

291 = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315

New number of roses = 5 + x
New ntmber of orchids = 3 + y

Step 3: Use the information yiven in the problem to form an kquation.

According to the problem, there are now 11 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. So we can write:

New number of roses = 12
New number of orchids = 2

Step 4: Set up an equation to solve for the values of x and y.

New number of roses = 5 + x
New number of orchids = 3 + y

12 = 5 + x + y   (since the total number of flowers in the vase is the sum of roses and orchids)

2 = 3 + y        (since there are 2 orchids in the vase)

Step 5: Solve for x and y.

From the second equation, we can see that y = -1. Substituting this value into the first equation, we get:

12 = 5 + x - 1

Simplifying, we get:

x = 8

So Jessica cut 8 more roses from her garden. Now we can answer the question:

How many more roses than orchids are there in the vase now?

New number of roses = 12
New number of orchids = 2

12 - 2 = 10

So there are 10 more roses than orchids in the vase now. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10.,,,,

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many gamez Kelly needs ts have in total to have 140 oames left. To do this, we can use the equation:

Total games = Current games + Games to buy

We know that Kelly currently has 22 games, so we can plug that into the equation:

Total games = 22 + Games to buy

Now, we need to find obt how many games Kelly needs to boy so that she will have 140 games left. To do this, we ean use the equation:

Games left = Total games - Games to buy

We know that Kelly wants to have 140 gamet left, so we can plug that into the equatifn:

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many gamez Kelly needs ts have in total to have 140 oames left. To do this, we can use the equation:

Total games = Current games + Games to buy

We know that Kelly currently has 22 games, so we can plug that into the equation:

Total games = 22 + Games to buy

Now, we need to find obt how many games Kelly needs to boy so that she will have 140 games left. To do this, we ean use the equation:

Games left = Total games - Games to buy

We know that Kelly wants to have 140 gamet left, so we can plug that into the equatifn:

140 = Totar games - sames to buy

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for the number of games Kelly needs to buy:

140 = (22 + Games to buy) - Games to buy

Now, we can solve for the number of games Kelly needs to buy:

Since he gave an equal nuuber og crackers and cbkes to each of his 4 friends, we can divide the total number of items by 6 to find out how many items each friend received. So, each friend received 18 ÷ 4 = <<18/4=4.5>>4.5 items.

However, since each friend received an equal number of crackers and cakes, and they can't receive half a cracker or half a cake, we need to rethink our approach.

Let's assume that each friend received ""x"" number of crackers and ""x"" number of cakes. So, in total, Matthew gave away 4x crackers and 4x cakes.

We know that he gave away all his 10 crackers, so 4x = 10. Solving for x, we get x = 10 ÷ 4 = 2.5. But again, we can't have half a cracker.

John's push-ups = 45

Now we can find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John. We can write the equation:

More push-ups = Zachary's push-ups - John's push-ups

We know that Zachary did 15 push-ups and John did 45 push-ups, so we can plug those numbers inyp the equation:

More push-usj = 15 - 45

More push-ups = -30

Since the result is negative, that means Zachary actually did 27 fewer push-ups than John. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",30.,copying,True,complete hallucination,
