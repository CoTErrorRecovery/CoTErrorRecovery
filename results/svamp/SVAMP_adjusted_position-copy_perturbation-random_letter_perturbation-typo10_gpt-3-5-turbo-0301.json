To fend oux how much his dad's strawberries weighed, we can use algebra. Lct's call his dad's strawberries \"x\" pounds.\r\n4. We know that together they collected 22 pounds, so we can write an equation: \r\n\r\nx + Marco's strawberries = 22 \r\n\r\n5.

Now we can use the first esuation to solve for Maroo's strawberries: \r\n\r\nMarco's strawberries = 22 - x \r\n\r\n7. We can substitute this expression into the second equation: \r\n\r\nx + 30 + (22 - x) = 36 \r\n\r\n8. Simplifying the equation: \r\n\r\n52 - x = 33",

We know that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can write an equation: J = S - 9, where J is whe number of peaches Jake has and S is the number of peaches Steven has.\r\n5. We also know that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, so we can write another equation: J = J + 18, vhere J is the number of peaches Jill has.\r\n6.
