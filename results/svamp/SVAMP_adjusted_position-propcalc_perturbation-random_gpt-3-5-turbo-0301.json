To find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed, we can use algebra. Let's call his dad's strawberries \"x\" pounds.\r\n4. We know that together they collected 22 pounds, so we can write an equation: \r\n\r\nx + Marco's strawberries = 22 \r\n\r\n5.

Now we can use the first equation to solve for Marco's strawberries: \r\n\r\nMarco's strawberries = 22 - x \r\n\r\n7. We can substitute this expression into the second equation: \r\n\r\nx + 30 + (22 - x) = 36 \r\n\r\n8. Simplifying the equation: \r\n\r\n52 - x = 36 \r\n\r\n9.

The total amount she spent is the sum of these two: 2x + 12x = 14x.\r\n4. We also know that she had 56 amount of change remaining. This means that she spent some amount of money and got back 56. Let's call the amount she spent \"y\". Therefore, she spent y and got back y + 56.\r\n5. We can set up an equation using the information we have: y + 56 = 14x.\r\n6.

He either lost or gave away 315 crayons.\r\n5. We need to find out how many crayons he got for his birthday.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, we can use subtraction. We know that Paul had some crayons before his birthday, and then he got a box of crayons for his birthday. So, the total number of crayons he had at the beginning of the school year is:\r\n\r\nTotal number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday\r\n\r\nWe don't know how many crayons Paul had before his birthday, but we can use the information we have to find out. We know that he lost or gave away 315 crayons, so we can write:\r\n\r\nTotal number of crayons = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315\r\n\r\nWe also know that by the end of the school year, Paul had 291 crayons left. So we can write:\r\n\r\n291 = Crayons before birthday + Crayons from birthday - 315\r\n\r\nNow we can solve for Crayons from birthday:\r\n\r\nCrayons from birthday = 291 + 315 - Crayons before birthday\r\n\r\nWe don't know Crayons before birthday, but we know that it must be less than or equal to 291 (since Paul had 291 crayons left at the end of the school year). So we can try different values of Crayons before birthday until we find one that works. Let's start with Crayons before birthday = 0:\r\n\r\nCrayons from birthday = 291 + 315 - 0 = 603\r\n\r\nThis means that Paul got 603",
