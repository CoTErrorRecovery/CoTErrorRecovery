Next, we need to find how many points they earned for recycling this amount of paper. We know that for every 9 pounds they earn one point, so we can set up a proportion:

9 pounds = 1 point
37 pounds = x points

9/1 = 37/x

Cross-multiplying, we get:

9x = 37

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:

x = 4.11

Since they can't earn a fraction of a point, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Vanessa and her friends earned 4 points for recycling 37 pounds of paper. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4,TRUE,calculation,explicitly identifies error,

"Q:  A pet shelter had 5 puppies when another 35 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted? 

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of puppies in the shelter after the new ones were brought in.

Total number of puppies = 5 + 35 = 38

Step 2: Find the number of puppies that need to be adopted.

To do this, we divide the number of remaining coloring books (80) by the number of coloring books per shelf (9): 80 ÷ 9 = 8.88

Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we round up to the nearest whole number: 9 shelves were used. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9,TRUE,calculation,explicitly identifies error,rounding

- To do this, we can multiply the number of scarves and mittens in one box by the number of boxes:

2 scarves/box x 4 boxes = 8 scarves
6 mittens/box x 4 boxes = 24 mittens

Finally, we can add the number of scarves and mittens together to find the total number of pieces of winter clothing:

8 scarves + 24 mittens = 31 pieces of winter clothing

Therefore, Chloe had a total of 31 pieces of winter clothing. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",31,,,,

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find the total number of pieces of candy Sarah received:

66 (from neighbors) + 15 (from sister) = 83

So, Sarah has 83 pieces of candy in total. Next, we need to divide this number by the number of pieces she eats per day:

83 ÷ 9 = 9.22 (rounded to two decimal places)

This means that Sarah can eat 9 pieces of candy per day for 9 days, but she will have some candy left over. To be more precise, we can multiply the number of days by the number of pieces she eats per day and subtract that from the total number of pieces:

5. Therefore, Olivia would have made $6. Note: It's important to double-check our work to make sure we didn't make any errors. In this case, we can check that Olivia made $6 by adding up the cost of the 3 bars she sold: 3 x $3 = $9. Since Olivia sold all but 4 bars, she would have kept the remaining 4 bars, which would be worth 4 x $3 = $12. Adding the $6 she made from selling the other bars to the $12 value of the remaining bars, we get a total of $18, which matches the $21 cost of the original box.

Now, we need to find out how many points Carol had after losing 16 points in the last round. To do this, we subtract the points she lost (16 points) from her total points after the first two rounds (20 points):

20 points - 16 points = 4 points

So, Carol had 4 points at the end of the game. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4,,,,

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find out how many sodas Jerry has in total. To do this, we add the number of regular sodas and diet sodas together: 41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = <<41+22=63>>63 sodas.

Now, we know that each shelf can hold 9 sodas. To find out how many shelves Jerry needs, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas per shelf: 63 sodas ÷ 9 sodas per shelf = <<63/9=4>>4 shelves. However, since 63 is not a multiple of 9, there will be some sodas left over that will need to go on another shelf. So, Jerry will need 4 full shelves and 1 more shelf for the remaining sodas, making a total of 5 shelves. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5 shelves.,,,,

He bought 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas, so he bought 4 + 52 = <<4+52=58>>58 sodas. Now, we need to find out how many shelves he would fill up. His fridge can hold 7 sodas on each shelf, so he would fill up 58 / 7 = 8.2857 shelves. Since he can't fill up a fraction of a shelf, he would need 9 shelves to hold all the sodas. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9,,,,

Now, we know that each member who showed up scored 5 points. So, to find the total points scored, we just need to multiply the number of members who showed up (7) by the points each member scored (5).

7 members * 5 points = <<7*5=32>>32 I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The correct calculation is:

7 members * 5 points = 35 points

So, the total points scored by the team is 35 points. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",35,,,,
