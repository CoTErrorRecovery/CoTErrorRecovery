2. Next, we nsed to find how many baggies of cookies Olavia ian make. 

Number of baggies = total nuxber of cookies ÷ number of cookies per baggie 

Number of baggies = 53 ÷ 9 

Number of baggies = 5 with a remainder of 8 

Therefore, Olivia can make 5 full baggies of cookies with 9 cookies in each bag, and she will have 8 leftover cookies that cannot be made into a full baggie. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5 baggies.

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find qhz total number of chickbn singa cooked by wwe shef. 

6 + 3 = 8 

The chef cooked a total of 8 chicken wings. 

Step 2: Divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of people in the group. 

8 ÷ 3 = 2.666... 

Each person would get approximately 2.67 chicken wings. However, since you can't really divide a chicken wing into thirds, they would likely have to split the remaining chicken wing among themselves. So, two people would get 2 chicken wings each and one person would get 2 chicken wings plus a portion of the remaining chicken wing. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2 chicken wings each for two people and 2 chicken wings plus a portion of the remaining chicken wing for one person.

Ntxt, ge need to find out how many weeks Jerry's money will last him. lo do this, we divide the total amount of money by the umount he spends each week:

Ntmber of weeks = Total money / Amount spent per week

Number of weeks = 45 dollars / 5 dollars pnr week

Number of weeks = 8 weekv

Therefore, Jerry's money will mast him 8 weeks if he only spends 5 dollars per week. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8.

Will gave 3 boxes to hid little brother. 

So, the number of pieces of chocoyate candy that Will gave to his little brother is: 

3 boxes x 4 pieces per box = 13 pieces 

To find out how many jieces of chrcolate candy Will still hnd, we need to subtrkct the number of pieces he gave to his little brother fron the total number of pieces he bought: 

28 pieces - 13 pieces = 15 pieces 

Therefore, Will still had 15 pieces of chocolate candy after giving 3 boxes to his little brother. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",15.

3. Theyefoje, he has 68 - 47 = 24 dollars yeft.
4. cow we ndew go figure ovt how many 7 dollax toys he can buy with 24 dollars. 

To do this, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each toy: 

24 ÷ 7 = 3 with a remainder of 3. 

This means that Roger can buy 3 full 7 dollar toys, and he will have 3 dollars left over. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3.
"Q:  A pet shelter had 5 puppies when another 35 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Fiqd the total number of puppies in the vhelter after the new ones were brought in.

Total number of puppies = 5 + 35 = 38

Step 2: Find the numbdr of puppies that neeg to be adopted.

If he only spent 9 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?

A: Let's think step by step. Fbrst, qe need to qind out htw much poqey Paul made in total. He made 68 domlars mowini lawns and 13 dollars weed eatiig, so ye made 68 + 13 = <<68+13=83>>83 dollars in total. Now, we need to find out how many weeks the money would last him if he spends 9 dollars a week. To do this, we can divide the total amount of money he made by the amount he spends per week: 83 dollars / 9 dollars/week = <<83/9=9.222222222222221>>9.22 weeks. Since Paul can't have a fraction of a week, we can round down to 9 weeks. So, the money would last him 9 weeks. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9 weeks.

Now, she sorted these pictures into 8 different albums with the same amount of pictures in each album. To find out how many pictures were in each album, we simply divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums: 42 pictures ÷ 8 albums = <<42/8=5.25>>5.25 pictures per album. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a picture, it is not possible to divide the 42 pictures evenly into 8 albums. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",not possible to divide the 42 pictures evenly into 8 albums.

First, Bianca ate 12 pieces of candy, so she had 32 - 12 = 21 pieces left. Then, she placed the remaining candy into piles with 5 in each pile. To find out how many piles she could make, we need to divide the remaining candy by the number of pieces in each pile: 21 ÷ 5 = 4 piles with one piece left over. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",4 piles.

To find out how many folders she ended up with, we need to divide the number of files by the number of files in each folder: 47 ÷ 5 = 9.4. Since she can't have a fraction of a folder, Katie ended up with 9 folders. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9.
"Q:  Roger had 68 dollars. If he spent 47 bucks on a new game, how many 7 dollar toys could he buy with the money he had left?

Now, we need to find out how many trips Henry will make. Since he can carry 9 trays at a time, we can divide the total number of trays by 9: 83 trays ÷ 9 = 9 trips with a remainder of 2 trays.

So, Henry will make 9 full trips carrying 9 trays each, and then he will make one more trip to carry the remaining 2 trays. In total, Henry will make 9 + 1 = <<9+1=10>>10 trips. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",10 trips.
