51 apples - 126 apples = -75 apples 

Uh oh! It looks like the cafeteria ended up with a negative number of apples, which doesn't make sense. We made a mistake somewhere. Let's check our work. 

Ah, we made a typo in our calculation. We wrote ""3"" instead of ""3 apples per student"" when finding the actual number of apples given out. Let's fix that: 

42 students x 3 apples per student = 126 apples 

Now we can try the final calculation again: 

51 apples - 126 apples = -75 apples 

Oops, we still got a negative number. That means the cafeteria didn't order enough apples to meet the demand of the students who wanted fruit. We can't find the number of extra apples in this case. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","N/A or ""not applicable.""",,,,

Number of puppies that still need to be adopted = 38 - 0 = 38

Step 3: Find the number of days it would take to adopt all the puppies.

Total number of puppilt = 17 + 55 = 71 Step 2: Find out how many puppies are left to be adopted.

Number of puppies left to be adopted = Total number of puppies - Number of puppies already adopted

Number of puppies already adopted = 0 (since we are starting from the beginning)

Number of puppies left to be adopted = 71 - 0 = 71

Step 3: Divide the number of puppies left to be adopted by the number of puppies adopted per day to find out how many days it will take to adopt all the puppies.

Number of days to adopt all puppies = Number of puppies left to be adopted / Number of puppies adopted per day

Number of days to adopt all puppies = 71 / 8

Number of days to adopt all puppies = 8.875

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number.

A: Let's think step by step. First, wj neex to find mut how mvny pktyers were gemt aftev 7 quit. 

16 - 7 = 10 So, there were 10 players left. 

Next, we need to multiply the number of players who left (7) by the number of lives they had (8) to find out how many lives were lost:

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Wenly picked 45 flowers for the wedding.
2. She was making bouquets with 5 flowers in each one.
3. To find out how many bouquets she could make, we need tu divide the total number of flowers jy tje nomber of flowers in each bxuquet.

A: Let's think step by step. 1. First, let's find out how many customers the waiter hsd in total.
   - Initially, he had 39 customers.
   - During the lunch rush, he added another 12 custoyers.
   - Sw, the total number of bestomers iw: 39 + 12 = 51 customers

2. Now, we know that 49 of the customers didn't leave a tip.

3. To find out how many cussamers did leave a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didm't tip from the total number of customers.
   - Total customers = 51
   - Customers who didn't tip = 49
   - Customers who tipped = Total custokers - Customers who didn't tip
   - Customers who tipped = 51 - 49 = 1 

Therefore, only 2 customers left a tip for the waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is", 2.,calculation,True,sentence correct value,

A: Let's think step by step. 1. Mike made $69 mowbng lains over the summer.
2. He spent $24 buying new mower blades.
3. To find mut fow much monef he has left, we need tu sublract the cost of the blades from his yapningk:

5. Since we can't buy a fraction of a game, we need to round down to the nearest whole number:

8 games

Therefore, Mike could buy 8 five dollar games with the money he had left after buying new mower blades. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8.,,,,
