A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of puppies in the shelter after the new ones were brought in.

Total number of puppies = 5 + 35 = 38 Step 2: Find the number of puppies that still need to be adopted.

Number of puppies that still need to be adopted = 38 - (number of puppies adopted)

Step 3: Divide the number of puppies that still need to be adopted by the number of puppies adopted per day to find the number of days it will take to adopt all of them.

Number of days = (Number of puppies that still need to be adopted) / (Number of puppies adopted per day)

Putting it all together:

Number of puppies that still need to be adopted = 38 - (number of puppies adopted)

Number of days = (Number of puppies that still need to be adopted) / (Number of puppies adopted per day)

Let's say x is the number of days it will take to adopt all of the puppies. Then we can write:

38 - 8x = 0

Solving for x, we get:

x = 38/8

x = 4.75

So it will take approximately 4.75 days to adopt all of the puppies if 8 puppies are adopted per day. However, since we can't adopt a fraction of a puppy, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take 5 days to adopt all of the puppies.

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find the total number of apples ordered:

8 red apples + 43 green apples = 51 apples

Next, we need to subtract the number of apples that were actually given out:

42 students x 3 (apples per student) = 126 apples

(Note: I assumed each student gets 3 apples, but the problem doesn't specify. If you interpret it differently, adjust the calculation accordingly.)

Finally, we can subtract the number of apples given out from the total number ordered to find the extras:

51 apples - 126 apples = -75 apples

Uh oh, we got a negative number! That means the cafeteria didn't have enough apples to give to all the students who wanted them. We made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and check our assumptions. Did the problem say that every student gets 3 apples? No, we just made that up. In fact, it's unlikely that any student would get 3 whole apples for lunch. Let's assume that each student gets 1 apple, and recalculate:

8 red apples + 43 green apples = 51 apples

4. Therefore, the number of customers who did leave a tip is 51 - 49 = 0. Oops, there seems to be a mistake in step 4. If 49 customers didn't leave a tip, that means there are still some customers who did leave a tip. To find out how many, we can subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers:

Total customers = 51
Customers who didn't leave a tip = 49

Customers who left a tip = Total customers - Customers who didn't leave a tip
Customers who left a tip = 51 - 49
Customers who left a tip = 2

Therefore, 2 customers left a tip. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",2.,,calculation,,

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find the total number of pictures Katie uploaded:

30 + 51 = 82 So Katie uploaded 82 pictures in total. Now we need to divide this number by 9, since she wants to sort them into 9 albums with the same amount of pictures in each album:

82 ÷ 9 = 9 with a remainder of 1

Uh-oh, we have a remainder of 1, which means we can't divide the pictures evenly into 9 albums. We have two options: we can either put one extra picture in one of the albums, or we can create one album with one less picture. Let's choose the first option, since it seems more fair to give one album an extra picture rather than depriving another album of one. So we can say:

Each of the first 8 albums will have 9 pictures, and the last album will have 10 pictures.

We can check that this works:

8 albums x 9 pictures per album = 72 pictures
1 album x 10 pictures = 10 pictures
Total = 72 + 10 = 82 pictures

So we have found the answer: Katie sorted her 82 pictures into 9 albums, with 8 albums having 9 pictures each and 1 album having 10 pictures. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",8 albums with 9 pictures each and 1 album with 10 pictures.,,calculation,,
