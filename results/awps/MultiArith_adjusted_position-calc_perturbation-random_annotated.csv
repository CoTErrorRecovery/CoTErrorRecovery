Total number of puppies = 5 + 35 = 38",5.0,sbs,"Q:  A pet shelter had 5 puppies when another 35 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of puppies in the shelter after the new ones were brought in.

Total number of puppies = 5 + 35 = 38 Step 2: Find the number of puppies that still need to be adopted.

Number of puppies that still need to be adopted = 38 - (number of puppies adopted)

Step 3: Divide the number of puppies that still need to be adopted by the number of puppies adopted per day to find the number of days it will take to adopt all of them.

Number of days = (Number of puppies that still need to be adopted) / (Number of puppies adopted per day)

Putting it all together:

Number of puppies that still need to be adopted = 38 - (number of puppies adopted)

Number of days = (Number of puppies that still need to be adopted) / (Number of puppies adopted per day)

Let's say x is the number of days it will take to adopt all of the puppies. Then we can write:

38 - 8x = 0

Solving for x, we get:

x = 38/8

x = 4.75

So it will take approximately 4.75 days to adopt all of the puppies if 8 puppies are adopted per day.

8 red apples + 43 green apples = 51 apples

Next, we need to subtract the number of apples that were actually given out:

42 students x 3 (apples per student) = 126 apples

(Note: I assumed each student gets 3 apples, but the problem doesn't specify. If you interpret it differently, adjust the calculation accordingly.)

Finally, we can subtract the number of apples given out from the total number ordered to find the extras:

51 apples - 126 apples = -75 apples

Uh oh, we got a negative number! That means the cafeteria didn't have enough apples to give to all the students who wanted them. We made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and check our assumptions. Did the problem say that every student gets 3 apples? No, we just made that up. In fact, it's unlikely that any student would get 3 whole apples for lunch. Let's assume that each student gets 1 apple, and recalculate:

Number of puppies that still need to be adopted = 0 (when all puppies are adopted)

Number of days = (number of puppies that still need to be adopted) / (number of puppies adopted per day)

Putting it all together, we get:

38 - 8d = 0

where d is the number of days it would take to adopt all the puppies.

Step 4: Solve for d.

38 - 8d = 0

8d = 38

d = 4.75

It would take approximately 4.75 days to adopt all the puppies. However, since we can't adopt a fraction of a puppy, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it would take 5 days to adopt all the puppies. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5.,calculation,,,

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find the total number of pieces of candy Sarah received:

66 (from neighbors) + 15 (from sister) = 83 Next, we need to divide the total number of pieces of candy by the number of pieces she eats per day:

83 ÷ 9 = 9.22 (rounded to two decimal places)

This means that Sarah can eat 9 pieces of candy per day for 9 days, but she will have some candy left over. To be more precise, we can multiply the number of days by the number of pieces she eats per day and subtract that from the total number of pieces:

9 x 9 = 81
83 - 81 = 2

So Sarah can eat 9 pieces of candy per day for 9 days, and she will have 2 pieces left over. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9 days.,calculation,,,

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. Step 1: Find the total number of players on the team.
Total number of players = number of new players + number of returning players
Total number of players = 2 + 6
Total number of players = 11",2.0,sbs_recovery,"Q:  There school's baseball team had 2 new players and 6 returning players. If the coach put them into groups with 4 players in each group, how many groups would there be?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. Step 1: Find the total number of players on the team.
Total number of players = number of new players + number of returning players
Total number of players = 2 + 6
Total number of players = 11 Step 2: Divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group to find the number of groups.
Number of groups = total number of players ÷ number of players in each group
Number of groups = 11 ÷ 4
Number of groups = 2 with a remainder of 3

Step 3: Since we can't have a group with only 3 players, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of groups.

We have two options: we can either put one extra picture in one of the albums, or we can create one album with one less picture. Let's choose the first option, since it seems more fair to give one album an extra picture rather than depriving another album of one. So we can say:

Each of the first 8 albums will have 9 pictures, and the last album will have 10 pictures.

We can check that this works:

8 albums x 9 pictures per album = 72 pictures
1 album x 10 pictures = 10 pictures

A: Let's think step by step. 1. First, let's find out how many puppies are left after selling 3:
   * The pet store had 18 puppies initially.
   * They sold 3 puppies.
   * So, the number of puppies left = 18 - 3 = 17  puppies

2. Now, we know that they put the remaining puppies into cages with 5 in each cage. To find the number of cages used, we need to divide the total number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies in each cage:
   * Number of cages used = Number of remaining puppies ÷ Puppies per cage
   * Number of cages used = 17 ÷ 5 = 3 cages with 2 puppies remaining

3. Since we can't have a fraction of a cage, they will need one more cage for the 2 remaining puppies.
