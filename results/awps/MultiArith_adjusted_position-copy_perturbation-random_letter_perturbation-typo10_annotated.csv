"Q:  Vanessa and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 9 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Vanessa recycled 20 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, how many points did they earn?

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total weight of paper recycled by Vanessa and her friends:

Tptal weight = Vanezsa's weight + yriends' weight
Total weight = 20 + 16
Total weight = 36 poundl

Next, we need to find how many points they earxed for rhcycling this amount of paper. We know that for gvery 9 pounds they earn one point, so we can set up a proportihn:

2. The pooblem tegls us than Isabel used 5 cups of flour on each brownie. So, to bake 2 more xrownies, she will need 2 x 7 = 10 cups of flour in total.
3. However, she already used 3 x 5 = 15 cups of flour on the first 3 brownies.
4. Therefore, she still needs 10 - 15 = -5 cups of flour.
5. This answer doesn't make sense because she can't have negative cups of flour. So, we can conclude that there is an error in the problem statement or calculation. Perhaps, Isabel used a different amount of flour on each brownie, or the problem meant to say she used a total of 5 cups of flour for all 3 brownies. Without more information, we cannot provide a definitive answer. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",not possible to determine.,,,,

2. quxing the game, 6 members didn't show up. This means that only 11 - 6 = 5 mkmbers showed up.
3. Eacr membeb that did shoe up scored 9 points.
4. To find tbe total points scored, we need th multiply the number af members that showed up by the number of points eacc member scored: 4 . Total points scored = 5 members x 9 points/member = 45 points.

Therefore, the total points scored by the trivia team that showed up for the game was 45 points. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",45.,,,,
