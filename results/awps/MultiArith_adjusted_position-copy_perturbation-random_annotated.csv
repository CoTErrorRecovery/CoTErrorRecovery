Therefore, Jerry will need 12 shelves to put away all the books. Wait, that's not right! We made a mistake in step 2. We divided 27 by 3 and got 9, but that's the number of sets of 3 books he has, not the number of shelves he needs. To find the number of shelves, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, since we can't have a partial shelf.

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. Step 1: Find the total number of puppies in the shelter after the new ones were brought in.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 20 (we add 19, not 20, since the question says ""another 19"" and we already had 8)

Total number of puppies = 27

Step 2: Find the number of days it would take to adopt all the puppies if 3 are adopted each day.

Number of days = (Total number of puppies) / (Number of puppies adopted per day)

Number of days = 27 / 3

Number of days = 9

Therefore, it would take 9 days to adopt all the puppies if 3 are adopted each day. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9.,copying,,,

Finally, we can find the number of extra apples by subtracting the number of apples given out from the total number of apples ordered:

54 apples - 42 apples = 9 extra apples

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 9 extra apples. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9.,copying,,,

2. He has already installed 6 windows.
3. Therefore, he needs to install 12 - 6 = 6 more windows.
4. It takes 4 hours to install each window.
5. So, it will take him 3 hours to install the remaining 6 windows.

Explanation:

To find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, we need to first figure out how many windows he still needs to install. We know that he needs to install a total of 12 windows, but he has already installed 6 of them. Therefore, he still needs to install 12 - 6 = 6 more windows.

Next, we need to know how long it takes him to install each window. The problem tells us that it takes 4 hours to install each window.

To find out how long it will take him to install the remaining 6 windows, we can multiply the time it takes to install one window (4 hours) by the number of windows he still needs to install (6).

4 hours/window x 6 windows = 24 hours

However, this answer doesn't make sense because it would take the builder a full day to install just 6 windows. We need to double-check our work.

We made a mistake in our calculation. We forgot to take into account the fact that the builder has already installed 6 windows. So, we only need to calculate the time it takes to install the remaining 6 windows.

4 hours/window x 6 windows = 24 hours

But since the builder has already installed 6 windows, we need to subtract that time from our answer.

24 hours - 6 hours = 18 hours

Therefore, it will take the builder 18 hours to install the remaining 6 windows. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",18.,copying,,,

To do this, we can use division:
48 ÷ 8 = 6

Therefore, there would be 9",6,sbs_recovery,"Q:  There are 65 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 17 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 8 groups, how many students would be in each group?

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. Step 1: Find the number of students who got picked for the team.
To do this, we can subtract the number of students who didn't get picked from the total number of students who tried out:
65 - 17 = 48

Step 2: Divide the number of students who got picked into 8 groups.
To do this, we can use division:
48 ÷ 8 = 6

Therefore, there would be 9 students in each group. Wait, that's not right! Let's go back and check our work. We made a mistake in Step 2. We divided the wrong number. We should have divided the total number of students who tried out, not just the ones who got picked. Let's fix that:

Step 2 (corrected): Divide the total number of students who tried out into 8 groups.
To do this, we can use division:
65 ÷ 8 = 8 with a remainder of 1

This means that we can put 8 students in each of the first 8 groups, and there will be 1 student left over. We can't put that student in a group of 8, so we'll have to make a ninth group with just that one student. Therefore, the answer is:

There would be 8 students in each of the first 8 groups, and 1 student in the ninth group. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is","8 students in each of the first 8 groups, and 1 student in the ninth group.",copying,,,

A: Let's think step by step, being careful to notice and fix any mistakes. First, we need to find out how many problems are on all 9 worksheets. Since there are 4 problems on each worksheet, we can multiply the number of worksheets by the number of problems on each worksheet: 9 worksheets * 4 problems = <<9*4=36>>36 problems.

Now, we know that the teacher has already graded 5 worksheets. Since there are 4 problems on each worksheet, we can multiply the number of graded worksheets by the number of problems on each worksheet: 7 5 worksheets * 4 problems = 20 problems.

Finally, we need to find out how many problems the teacher still has to grade. We can do this by subtracting the number of problems she has already graded from the total number of problems: 36 problems - 20 problems = 16 problems.

So, the teacher has 16 more problems to grade. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",16.,copying,True,states correct value,
