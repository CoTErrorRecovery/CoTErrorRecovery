A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many tickets Tom has left after playing at the 'dunk a clown' booth. To do this, we subtract the number of tickets he spent at the booth from the total number of tickets he bought: 40 - 29 I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Let's try this again.

First, we need to find out how many tickets Tom has left after playing at the 'dunk a clown' booth. To do this, we subtract the number of tickets he spent at the booth from the total number of tickets he bought: 40 - 28 = 12 tickets left.

Now, we need to find out how many rides he can go on with the remaining tickets. Since each ride costs 4 tickets, we can divide the number of remaining tickets by the cost per ride: 12 / 4 = 3 rides. So, Tom can go on 3 rides with his remaining tickets. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3.,copying,True,explicitly identifies error,
