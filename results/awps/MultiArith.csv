2. She finished 6 of them.
3. She still had 7 pages of problems to do.
4. We need to find out how many problems are on each page.

To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's call the number of problems on each page ""x"". Then we can set up an equation:

6 + 7x = 55

We add 6 to both sides because Sarah finished 6 problems. Then we multiply the number of pages (7) by the number of problems on each page (x) and add that to the 6 problems she already finished. This should equal the total number of problems (55).

Now we can solve for x:

7x = 49

We subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the variable:

7x - 6 = 49 - 6

7x = 43

Finally, we divide both sides by 7 to solve for x:

However, since the problem only specifies the number of red and green apples, we can assume that all 9 students wanted red apples (since there are more red apples than green). 

In that case, the cafeteria would have used up all 42 red apples, and would have 7 green apples left over. So the answer is 7."

",16.0,qa zeroshot direct,"Q:  Faye and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Faye picked 23 and her mother picked 5. If only 12 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have? 

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","16. 

Explanation: 

If only 12 of the 23 carrots that Faye picked were good, then she had 23 - 12 = 11 bad carrots. 

If only 12 of the 5 carrots that Faye's mom picked were good, then she had 5 - 12 = -7 bad carrots. 

However, it doesn't make sense to have negative bad carrots, so we assume that Faye's mom also had 11 bad carrots (since they were picking from the same garden). 

Therefore, the total number of bad carrots they had was 11 + 11 = 22. 

(Note: It's possible that some of the carrots they picked were neither good nor bad, but the problem doesn't provide that information.)"

Explanation: 

To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out. 

Total number of students who tried out = 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students 

Number of students who got called back = 26 

Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students who tried out - Number of students who got called back

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","8 vases. 

Explanation: 

Since each vase can hold 6 flowers, we need to divide the total number of flowers by 6 to find out how many vases we need. 

Total number of flowers = 7 carnations + 47 roses = 54 flowers 

Number of vases needed = 54 flowers ÷ 6 flowers per vase = 9 vases

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","7 days. 

Explanation: 

Initially, the shelter had 9 puppies. When 12 more were brought in, the total number of puppies became 9 + 12 = 21. 

Let's assume that x days are needed to adopt all the puppies. 

In one day, 3 puppies are adopted. So in x days, 3x puppies will be adopted. 

Therefore, the number of puppies left to be adopted after x days is: 

21 - 3x 

We want this number to be zero, meaning all puppies have been adopted. 

So we can set up the equation: 

21 - 3x = 0 

Solving for x: 

21 = 3x 

x = 7 

Therefore, it would take 7 days to adopt all the puppies if 3 puppies are adopted each day."

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","unknown as it requires further information. 

To find the answer, we need to know how many puppies are left after some have been adopted. We can start by adding the number of puppies in the shelter before and after the new ones were brought in: 

17 + 55 = 72 

So there are now 72 puppies in the shelter. 

Next, we need to figure out how many days it will take to adopt all of them. We can start by subtracting the number of puppies adopted each day from the total number of puppies:

So after one day, there will be 64 puppies left in the shelter. 

We can continue this process to see how many days it will take to adopt all of the puppies: 

Day 1: 64 puppies 
Day 2: 56 puppies 
Day 3: 48 puppies

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","8 baggies. 

Explanation: 

First, we need to determine how many bags of cookies we can make with the chocolate chip cookies and how many we can make with the oatmeal cookies. 

For the chocolate chip cookies: 

- Divide the total number of chocolate chip cookies by the number of cookies per bag: 

23 ÷ 6 = 3 with a remainder of 5 

- This means Robin can make 3 full bags of chocolate chip cookies, with 6 cookies in each bag, and she will have 5 leftover cookies. 

For the oatmeal cookies: 

- Divide the total number of oatmeal cookies by the number of cookies per bag: 

25 ÷ 6 = 4 with a remainder of 1 

- This means Robin can make 4 full bags of oatmeal cookies, with 6 cookies in each bag, and she will have 1 leftover cookie. 

Now we need to determine how many bags Robin can make in total. 

- Add the number of full bags of chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies: 

3 + 4 = 7 

- This means Robin can make 7 full bags of cookies. 

- However, she still has 6 leftover cookies (5 chocolate chip and 1 oatmeal). 

- Since she can't make a full bag with these leftovers, she can make one more bag with the 6 cookies combined. 

- Therefore, Robin can make a total of 8 bags of cookies."

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","9 days. 

Explanation: 

Initially, the shelter had 2 puppies. When 34 more were brought in, the total number of puppies became 2 + 34 = 36. 

Let's assume that x days are needed to adopt all the puppies. 

In one day, 4 puppies are adopted. So in x days, the number of puppies left in the shelter would be 36 - 4x. 

We want all the puppies to be adopted, so we set 36 - 4x = 0 and solve for x: 

36 - 4x = 0 

4x = 36 

x = 9 

Therefore, it would take 9 days to adopt all the puppies if 4 puppies are adopted each day."

",16.0,qa zeroshot direct,"Q:  A painter needed to paint 10 rooms in a building. Each room takes 8 hours to paint. If he already painted 8 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest? 

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","16 hours.

Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, the painter needs a total of 8 x 10 = 80 hours to paint all 10 rooms. 

If he already painted 8 rooms, he has completed 8 x 8 = 64 hours of work.

",12.0,qa zeroshot direct,"Q:  In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 3 points. If a level has 6 enemies total and you destroy all but 2 of them, how many points would you earn? 

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","18. 

Explanation: 

If each enemy defeated gives you 3 points, and there are 6 enemies total, then defeating all 6 enemies would give you: 

6 enemies x 3 points per enemy = 18 points 

However, in this scenario, you only destroy all but 2 of the enemies. That means you defeat 4 enemies: 

6 enemies total - 2 enemies remaining = 4 enemies defeated 

To find out how many points you earn, you can multiply the number of enemies defeated by the points per enemy: 

4 enemies defeated x 3 points per enemy = 12 points 

Therefore, you would earn 12 points if you destroy all but 2 of the 6 enemies in the level."

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","42 hours.

Explanation:

Since each room takes 7 hours to paint, the total time needed to paint 12 rooms is:

12 rooms x 7 hours per room = 84 hours

Since the painter already painted 5 rooms, he still needs to paint:

12 total rooms - 5 rooms already painted = 7 rooms left to paint

To find out how much longer he will take to paint the rest, we need to multiply the number of rooms left by the time it takes to paint each room:

7 rooms left to paint x 7 hours per room = 49 hours

Therefore, the painter will take an additional 49 hours to paint the remaining 7 rooms. However, since he already spent some time painting the first 5 rooms, we need to subtract that time from the total:

49 hours - (5 rooms already painted x 7 hours per room) = 42 hours

So the final answer is 42 hours."

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","24 hours. 

Explanation: 

Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, the painter needs a total of 9 x 8 = 72 hours to paint all 9 rooms. 

If he already painted 5 rooms, he has 4 rooms left to paint. 

To calculate how much longer he will take to paint the rest, we need to multiply the number of remaining rooms by the time it takes to paint one room: 

4 rooms x 8 hours per room = 32 hours 

Therefore, the painter will need an additional 32 hours to finish painting the remaining 4 rooms. 

Alternatively, we could also subtract the time already spent painting from the total time needed to paint all 9 rooms: 

Total time needed: 9 rooms x 8 hours per room = 72 hours 

Time already spent: 5 rooms x 8 hours per room = 40 hours

- Each bar costs $3, so 6 bars would cost 6 x $3 = $18. 
- However, Wendy made money from selling the bars, so we need to add that to the total. 
- Since she sold all but 3 bars, she kept 3 bars for herself. So she made 6 x $3 = $18 from selling the bars, and she kept 3 x $3 = $9 worth of bars for herself. 
- Therefore, Wendy would have made a total of $18 + $9 = $27 from the box of chocolate bars."

To find out how much money Oliver had left after buying the new mower blades, we can subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns: 

35 - 7 = 28 

So Oliver had 28 dollars left. 

To figure out how many 4 dollar games he could buy with that money, we can divide the amount he has left by the cost of each game: 

28 ÷ 4 = 7 

Therefore, Oliver could buy 7 4-dollar games with the money he had left after buying the new mower blades."

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","4. 

Explanation: 

Initially, the waiter had 22 customers in his section. After 14 of them left, he was left with 22 - 14 = 8 customers. 

If the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table, we can find the number of tables by dividing the number of customers by 4: 

8 customers / 4 customers per table = 2 tables 

Therefore, the waiter had 2 tables in addition to the 14 customers who left. 

Alternatively, we could also find the total number of tables the waiter had by dividing the initial number of customers by 4: 

22 customers / 4 customers per table = 5.5 tables 

Since the number of tables must be a whole number, we can round up to 6 tables. Subtracting the 2 tables with the remaining 8 customers, we get 6 - 2 = 4 tables for the rest of the customers."

If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team? 

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","5 players. 

Explanation: 

Let's call the number of players on Bianca's team ""x"". 

We know that Bianca scored 45 points, and everyone else scored 6 points each. So the total number of points scored can be expressed as: 

45 + 6(x-1) 

The ""x-1"" is because we're subtracting Bianca from the total number of players to get the number of ""everyone else"" players. 

We also know that the total number of points scored was 75. So we can set up an equation: 

45 + 6(x-1) = 75 

Simplifying: 

45 + 6x - 6 = 75 

6x = 36 

x = 6 

So there were 6 players on the team, including Bianca. But we were asked for the number of ""everyone else"" players, so we subtract 1: 

x - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 

Therefore, there were 5 players on Bianca's team who were not Bianca."

If he had to pick up 17 trays from one table and 55 trays from another, how many trips will he make? 

A: Let's think step by step. First, Dave needs to pick up 17 trays from one table. Since he can carry 9 trays at a time, he will need to make 2 trips for this table (9 trays on the first trip and 8 trays on the second trip).

Next, Dave needs to pick up 55 trays from the other table. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we can divide 55 by 9. 55 ÷ 9 = 6 with a remainder of 1. This means Dave will need to make 6 trips carrying 9 trays each, and then 1 more trip to carry the last tray.

So in total, Dave will make 2 trips for the first table and 7 trips for the second table, which equals 2 + 7 = <<2+7=9>>9 trips. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9

However, we need to consider that Henry might not be able to carry a full load of 9 trays on his last trip. To find out if this is the case, we need to find the remainder when we divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry at once: 81 trays % 9 trays/trip = <<81%9=0>>0 trays.

If he had to pick up 23 trays from one table and 5 trays from another, how many trips will he make? 

A: Let's think step by step. First, Victor needs to pick up the 23 trays from the first table. Since he can carry 7 trays at a time, he will need to make 23/7 = 3 trips to carry all the trays from the first table. However, 3 trips will only allow him to carry 3*7 = 21 trays, so he will need to make one more trip to carry the remaining 2 trays. This makes a total of 4 trips for the first table.

Now, Victor needs to pick up the 5 trays from the second table. Since he can carry 7 trays at a time, he can pick up all 5 trays in just one trip.

So, in total, Victor will make 4 trips for the first table + 1 trip for the second table = 5 trips. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many problems are on all the worksheets. To do this, we multiply the number of problems on one worksheet (7) by the total number of worksheets (17). So, 7 * 17 = 119 problems in total.

Now, we need to find out how many problems the teacher has already graded. Since she has graded 8 worksheets, and each worksheet has 7 problems, she has graded 8 * 7 = 56 problems.

Finally, we need to find out how many problems are left for her to grade. To do this, we subtract the number of problems she has already graded (56) from the total number of problems (119). So, 119 - 56 = 63 problems left to grade. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",63

Now we know that Emily planted 6 seeds in her small gardens. Since she planted 2 seeds in each small garden, we can find the number of small gardens by dividing the number of seeds by the number of seeds per garden:

6 seeds / 2 seeds per garden = 3 small gardens

So, Emily had 3 small gardens. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",3

   * Number of loads = 27 ÷ 9 = 3

4) However, we can't have a fraction of a load. If there are any remaining pieces of clothing after 3 loads, Nancy will need to do an additional load.

5) To check for remaining pieces:
   * Pieces of clothing washed in 3 loads = 9 × 3 = 27
   * Remaining pieces = Total pieces of clothing - Pieces of clothing washed in 3 loads
   * Remaining pieces = 27 - 27 = 0
