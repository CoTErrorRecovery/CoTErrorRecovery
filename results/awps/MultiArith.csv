If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team? 

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Bianca scored 45 points. 

Next, we need to figure out how many points were scored by the other players. We know that everyone else scored 6 points each, so we can use division to figure out how many other players there were: 

75 - 45 = 30 

30 ÷ 6 = 5 

So there were 5 other players on Bianca's team. 

To check our work, we can add up all the points: 

45 + (5 x 6) = 75 

So our answer is correct! Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",5,False,True

Explanation: 

If only 12 of the 23 carrots that Faye picked were good, then she had 23 - 12 = 11 bad carrots. 

If only 12 of the 5 carrots that Faye's mom picked were good, then she had 5 - 12 = -7 bad carrots. 

However, it doesn't make sense to have negative bad carrots, so we assume that Faye's mom also had 11 bad carrots (since they were picking from the same garden).

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","7 days. 

Explanation: 

Initially, the shelter had 9 puppies. When 12 more were brought in, the total number of puppies became 9 + 12 = 21. 

Let's assume that x days are needed to adopt all the puppies. 

In one day, 3 puppies are adopted. So in x days, 3x puppies will be adopted. 

Therefore, the number of puppies left to be adopted after x days is: 

21 - 3x 

We want this number to be zero, meaning all puppies have been adopted. 

So we can set up the equation:

To find out how many trips Dave will make, we need to divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry at once (9). 

For the first table, he needs to pick up 17 trays. 

17 ÷ 9 = 1 with a remainder of 8 

This means he can carry 1 set of 9 trays, and then he'll have to make a second trip for the remaining 8 trays. 

For the second table, he needs to pick up 55 trays. 

55 ÷ 9 = 6 with a remainder of 1 

This means he can carry 6 sets of 9 trays, and then he'll have to make a seventh trip for the remaining 1 tray. 

So in total, Dave will make 1 + 6 + 1 = 8 trips.",False,False

" Robin was making baggies of cookies with 6 cookies in each bag. If she had 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make? ",8,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,qa zeroshot direct,"Q:  Robin was making baggies of cookies with 6 cookies in each bag. If she had 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make? 

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","8 baggies. 

Explanation: 

First, we need to determine how many bags of cookies we can make with the chocolate chip cookies and how many we can make with the oatmeal cookies. 

For the chocolate chip cookies: 

- Divide the total number of chocolate chip cookies by the number of cookies per bag: 

23 ÷ 6 = 3 with a remainder of 5 

- This means Robin can make 3 full bags of chocolate chip cookies, with 6 cookies in each bag, and she will have 5 leftover cookies. 

For the oatmeal cookies: 

- Divide the total number of oatmeal cookies by the number of cookies per bag: 

25 ÷ 6 = 4 with a remainder of 1 

- This means Robin can make 4 full bags of oatmeal cookies, with 6 cookies in each bag, and she will have 1 leftover cookie. 

Now we need to determine how many bags Robin can make in total. 

- Add the number of full bags of chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies: 

3 + 4 = 7 

- This means Robin can make 7 full bags of cookies. 

- However, she still has 6 leftover cookies (5 chocolate chip and 1 oatmeal). 

- Since she can't make a full bag with these leftovers, she can make one more bag with the 6 cookies combined. 

- Therefore, Robin can make a total of 8 bags of cookies.",False,False

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","42 hours.

Explanation:

Since each room takes 7 hours to paint, the total time needed to paint 12 rooms is:

12 rooms x 7 hours per room = 84 hours

Since the painter already painted 5 rooms, he still needs to paint:

12 total rooms - 5 rooms already painted = 7 rooms left to paint

To find out how much longer he will take to paint the rest, we need to multiply the number of rooms left by the time it takes to paint each room:

7 rooms left to paint x 7 hours per room = 49 hours

Therefore, the painter will take an additional 49 hours to paint the remaining 7 rooms. However, since he already spent some time painting the first 5 rooms, we need to subtract that time from the total:

If he already painted 5 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest? 

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","24 hours. 

Explanation: 

Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, the painter needs a total of 9 x 8 = 72 hours to paint all 9 rooms. 

If he already painted 5 rooms, he has 4 rooms left to paint. 

To calculate how much longer he will take to paint the rest, we need to multiply the number of remaining rooms by the time it takes to paint one room: 

4 rooms x 8 hours per room = 32 hours 

Therefore, the painter will need an additional 32 hours to finish painting the remaining 4 rooms. 

Alternatively, we could also subtract the time already spent painting from the total time needed to paint all 9 rooms: 

Total time needed: 9 rooms x 8 hours per room = 72 hours 

Time already spent: 5 rooms x 8 hours per room = 40 hours

" Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team? ",5,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,qa zeroshot direct,"Q:  Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team? 

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is","5 players. 

Explanation: 

Let's call the number of players on Bianca's team ""x"". 

We know that Bianca scored 45 points, and everyone else scored 6 points each. So the total number of points scored can be expressed as: 

45 + 6(x-1) 

The ""x-1"" is because we're subtracting Bianca from the total number of players to get the number of ""everyone else"" players. 

We also know that the total number of points scored was 75. So we can set up an equation: 

45 + 6(x-1) = 75 

Simplifying: 

45 + 6x - 6 = 75 

6x = 36 

x = 6 

So there were 6 players on the team, including Bianca. But we were asked for the number of ""everyone else"" players, so we subtract 1: 

x - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 

Therefore, there were 5 players on Bianca's team who were not Bianca.",False,False

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many adults are in the group. We know there are 12 people in total and 7 of them are kids. So, we can subtract the number of kids from the total number of people to find the number of adults: 12 - 7 = 5 adults.

Now, we know that each adult meal costs $3. So, to find the total cost for the adult meals, we can multiply the number of adults by the cost per adult meal: 5 adults * $3/adult meal = $15.

Since kids eat free, we don't need to worry about their meal costs. So, the total cost for the group to eat would be $15. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",15,True,False

16 total action figures - 7 action figures Jerry already has = 9 action figures needed

Now that we know Jerry needs 9 more action figures, we can find out how much money he needs by multiplying the number of action figures needed by the cost of each action figure:

9 action figures needed * $8 per action figure = $72 needed

So, Jerry needs $72 to finish his collection. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",72,True,False

There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? 

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many books Oliver has left to put away after the librarian takes 10 books. To do this, we subtract 10 from the total number of books, which is 46:

46 - 10 = 36 books

Now, we need to find out how many shelves Oliver will need to put away these 36 books. Since each shelf can fit 4 books, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:

She started with 52 seeds and planted 40 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 2 seeds each. How many small gardens did Bianca have? 

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many seeds Bianca planted in the small gardens. To do this, we subtract the number of seeds she planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds she had:

52 seeds (total) - 40 seeds (big garden) = 12 seeds (small gardens)

Now, we know that Bianca planted 2 seeds in each small garden. To find out how many small gardens she had, we divide the number of seeds she planted in the small gardens by the number of seeds per small garden:

12 seeds (small gardens) / 2 seeds per small garden = 6 small gardens

So, Bianca had 6 small gardens. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",6,True,False
