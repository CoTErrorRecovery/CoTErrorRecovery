Now, we need to find out how many shelves they used to put the remaining coloring books. To do this, we divide the number of remaining coloring books (81) by the number of coloring books per shelf (9): 81 ÷ 9 = <<81/9=9>>9 shelves. So, they used 9 shelves to put the remaining coloring books. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",9.,calculation,True,states correct value,

   * Total money made = $68 + $13 = $82 . So, Paul made a total of $81.

2. Now, we know that Paul spends $9 per week. To find out how long the money will last, we need to divide the total money by the weekly spending.
   * Money lasting time = Total money ÷ Weekly spending
   * Money lasting time = $81 ÷ $9 = 9 weeks

Therefore, the $81 Paul made will last him 9 weeks if he spends $9 per week. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is", 9.,calculation,True,sentence correct value,

   * Total number of bears = 6 + 18 = 25  bears

2. Now, we know that they put 6 bears on each shelf. To find the number of shelves used, we need to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf:

A: Let's think step by step. 2  steps are needed to solve this problem:

1. Find the total number of people playing volleyball.
