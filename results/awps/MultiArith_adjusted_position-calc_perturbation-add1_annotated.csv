A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people actually showed up to the luncheon. We know that 45 people were invited, and 35 didn't show up. So, we can subtract the number of people who didn't show up from the total number of people invited:

45 people (invited) - 35 people (didn't show up) = 11",5,gpt-4-0314,sbs,"Q:  A company invited 45 people to a luncheon, but 35 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 2 people each, how many tables do they need? 

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people actually showed up to the luncheon. We know that 45 people were invited, and 35 didn't show up. So, we can subtract the number of people who didn't show up from the total number of people invited:
