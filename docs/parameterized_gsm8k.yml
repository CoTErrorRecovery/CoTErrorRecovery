  answer: In the beginning, Betty has only 100 / 2 = $<<100/2=50>>50.\nBetty's grandparents gave her 15 * 2 = $<<15*2=30>>30.\nThis means, Betty needs 100 - 50 - 30 - 15 = $<<100-50-30-15=5>>5 more.\n#### 5
  answer_template: In the beginning, Betty has only {N_00} / 2 = ${N_02_formula}{N_02}.\nBetty's grandparents gave her {N_01} * 2 = ${N_03_formula}{N_03}.\nThis means, Betty needs {N_00} - {N_02} - {N_03} - {N_01} = $<<{N_04_formula}>>{N_04} more.\n#### {N_04}

  answer: There are 80/100 * 10 = <<80/100*10=8>>8 more purple flowers than yellow flowers.\nSo in Mark's garden, there are 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 purple flowers.\nPurple and yellow flowers sum up to 10 + 18 = <<10+18=28>>28 flowers.\nThat means in Mark's garden there are 25/100 * 28 = <<25/100*28=7>>7 green flowers.\nSo in total Mark has 28 + 7 = <<28+7=35>>35 plants in his garden.\n#### 35
  answer_template: There are {N_01}/100 * {N_00} = <<{N_03_formula}>>{N_03} more purple flowers than yellow flowers.\nSo in Mark's garden, there are {N_00} + {N_03} = <<{N_04_formula}>>N_04 purple flowers.\nPurple and yellow flowers sum up to N_00 + N_04 = <<{N_05_formula}>>{N_05} flowers.\nThat means in Mark's garden there are {N_02}/100 * {N_05} = <<{N_06_formula}>>{N_06} green flowers.\nSo in total Mark has {N_05} + {N_06} = <<{N_07_formula}>>{N_07} plants in his garden.\n#### {N_07}

  answer: She works 8 hours a day for $18 per hour so she makes 8*18 = $<<8*18=144.00>>144.00 per 8-hour shift\nShe works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10-8 = <<10-8=2>>2 hours of overtime\nOvertime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes $18/hour so her overtime pay is 18*.5 = $<<18*.5=9.00>>9.00\nHer overtime pay is 18+9 = $<<18+9=27.00>>27.00\nHer base pay is $144.00 per 8-hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * $144 = $<<144*5=720.00>>720.00\nHer overtime pay is $27.00 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 27*2 = $<<27*2=54.00>>54.00 in overtime pay\n2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 54*5 = $270.00\nIn 5 days her base pay is $720.00 and she makes $270.00 in overtime pay so she makes $720 + $270 = $<<720+270=990.00>>990.00\n#### 990
